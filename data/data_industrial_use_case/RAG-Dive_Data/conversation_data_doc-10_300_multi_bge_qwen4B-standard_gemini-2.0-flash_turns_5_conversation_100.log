Validation failed for title: Everton_F.C..md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who replaced him on a temporary basis before Moyes?', 'question': "After Walter Smith was sacked as Everton's manager, who replaced him on a temporary basis before David Moyes took over?", 'answer': 'Dave Watson.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' must be a standalone rephrasing of the 'rag_input' and not identical to it. Here, the 'Question' is exactly the same as the 'rag_input', so it fails the rephrasing requirement and does not satisfy the stand-alone, self-contained criterion.

Validation failed for title: Hindu_philosophy.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's the role of a guru in achieving this direct realization?", 'question': 'According to Advaita Vedanta, what role does a guru play in helping someone achieve the direct realization of Atman and Brahman necessary for liberation, beyond simply understanding māyā?', 'answer': 'The document mentions that true liberation comes from direct, non-dual experience—a state where the individual realizes *ātman = Brahman* not through logic or reasoning, but through inner insight, often through meditation, self-inquiry (*atman-vichara*), or the guidance of a guru.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'The document mentions', which violates the constraint to not refer to any provided document. The response must be self-contained and not mention sources. The content itself is otherwise aligned with the topic, but the document reference makes it invalid.

Validation failed for title: Hokkien.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned Japanese loanwords in Taiwanese Hokkien. Are there loanwords from other languages too?', 'question': 'Given that Taiwanese Hokkien is Amoy-based but has evolved with regional variations and that it contains Japanese loanwords, are there loanwords from other languages present in Taiwanese Hokkien as well?', 'answer': 'On the other hand, the variants spoken in Singapore and Malaysia have a substantial number of loanwords from Malay and to a lesser extent, from English and other Chinese varieties, such as the closely related Teochew and some Cantonese.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is not identical to the 'rag_input' field as required by the first-turn format. It introduces additional context (e.g., 'Amoy-based' and 'regional variations') not present in the rag_input, violating the rule that 'Question' must be exactly the same as the rag_input for the initial turn.

Validation failed for title: Prime_minister.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, how did the role change during wartime, specifically?', 'question': 'Following the evolution of the prime minister in England, how did the role specifically change during wartime?', 'answer': "During wartime, the prime minister's role often became more consolidated and powerful. Prime ministers like William Pitt the Younger used their position to manage national crises and maintain control over Parliament. A wartime prime minister might also take on additional ministerial posts, such as Winston Churchill's role as Minister of Defence during World War II, even though the Ministry of Defence didn't formally exist then. The need for decisive leadership and efficient governance during wartime often strengthens the prime minister's authority.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer contains a factual inaccuracy: it claims Churchill served as Minister of Defence during World War II, but the Ministry of Defence did not exist until 1964. During WWII, Churchill was Prime Minister and held roles such as War and Air (and other wartime portfolios), not a standalone Minister of Defence. This compromises the factual correctness of the response.

Validation failed for title: Prime_minister.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, if the Prime Minister in India doesn't dissolve Parliament, what powers do they actually have?", 'question': 'Given that the Prime Minister of India does not have the power to dissolve Parliament, what functions and powers does the Prime Minister of India possess?', 'answer': "The document mentions that Bangladesh and Czech Republic constitutions clearly outline the functions and powers of the Prime Minister. However, it doesn't describe what those powers are, and doesn't detail the powers of the Indian Prime Minister. Therefore, I cannot answer this question.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer is not factually correct. The question asks about the Prime Minister of India's powers, but the response claims it cannot answer because the powers aren’t described in the document. The prior content indicates that in India the PM is the head of government and leads the Council of Ministers, with powers such as appointing/dismissing ministers, advising the President on governance, chairing Cabinet meetings, and setting government policy. Therefore, the provided answer is incorrect.

Validation failed for title: Prime_minister.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Is there a general rule about when 'Prime Minister' is used versus these other titles?", 'question': "Given the variety of titles used for the head of government in different countries, is there a general rule or principle that determines when the title 'Prime Minister' is used versus these alternative titles?", 'answer': 'The convention in the English language is to call nearly all national heads of government "prime minister" (sometimes modified to the equivalent term of premier), regardless of the correct title of the head of government as applied in his or her respective country. The few exceptions to the rule are Germany and Austria, whose heads of government titles are almost always translated as Chancellor; Monaco, whose head of government is referred to as the Minister of State; and Vatican City, for which the head of government is titled the Secretary of State. In the case of Ireland, the head of government is occasionally referred to as the Taoiseach by English speakers. A stand-out case is the President of Iran, who is not actually a head of state, but the head of the government of Iran. He is referred to as "president" in both the Persian and English languages.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The answer omits Spain as an exception; in Spain the head of government is officially the President of the Government (Presidente del Gobierno), though it is commonly referred to as the prime minister in English. The list is incomplete, making the answer inaccurate per the source content.

Validation failed for title: Communication.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Could you elaborate on the role of personal filters in that model?', 'question': 'Based on the communication dimensions you described previously, could you elaborate on the role of personal filters in how messages are interpreted?', 'answer': 'The sender\'s personal filters and the receiver\'s personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents. In the presence of "communication noise" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it relies on prior conversation by saying 'Based on the communication dimensions you described previously,' which makes it non-self-contained. The Question should be a self-contained rephrase of the RAG_input without referencing prior turns or context.

Validation failed for title: Sichuan.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Can you elaborate on the changes to China's foreign trade policy?", 'question': "Given that changes in China's foreign trade policy were identified as a factor contributing to Sichuan's increased foreign trade in 2008, can you provide more detail on what those policy changes were?", 'answer': "This document does not contain information about the specifics of the changes to China's foreign trade policy.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule 2 violated: The Question must be an exact standalone restatement of the rag_input; the provided Question is not identical to the rag_input and adds extra context about Sichuan and 2008 trade. This violates the requirement that they be identical in the first turn. Additionally, Rule 4 is violated: The Answer asserts there is no information, but the document mentions policy changes as a factor, so the answer is not factually correct.

Validation failed for title: Appalachian_Mountains.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which one is older, geologically speaking?', 'question': 'Considering the Ridge and Valley province and the Appalachian Plateaus, which one formed earlier in geological history?', 'answer': 'The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not directly compare Ridge and Valley versus Appalachian Plateaus or state which formed earlier. It gives a general formation time for the Appalachians rather than addressing the specific comparison asked.

Validation failed for title: BBC_Television.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Before BBC1 and BBC2, what was the original BBC television service called, and where did it broadcast from?', 'question': 'Before the existence of BBC1 and BBC2, what was the original BBC television service called, and from which location did it initially broadcast its programmes?', 'answer': 'The original BBC television service was called BBC Television. Regular BBC television broadcasts officially resumed on 1 October 1936, from a converted wing of Alexandra Palace in London.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer states the original BBC television service was called 'BBC Television', but the historically correct name was 'BBC Television Service' (renamed 'BBC TV' in 1960). The location/date (Alexandra Palace, 1 October 1936) is correct, but the naming is inaccurate.

Validation failed for title: Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was that the same year as the August coup?', 'question': 'Was November 6, 1991, when the Communist Parties of the USSR and the RSFSR were banned, the same year as the August coup?', 'answer': 'Yes, it was.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Violations: 1) Rag_input is not clearly built on the prior turn and does not follow up on 'Was that the same year as the August coup?'. 2) Question is identical to the rag_input rather than a standalone rephrasing; it should be self-contained and not simply repeat the prompt. 3) The output does not specify a Type consistent with the prior Follow-up designation. 4) Answer is incomplete/wrong in date format; it should be 'November 6, 1991'.

Validation failed for title: Estonian_language.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did the use of the Estonian language change during the Soviet era?', 'question': 'Given that the percentage of ethnic Estonians speaking the language may have changed during the Soviet era, did the actual usage and status of the Estonian language itself also change?', 'answer': 'When Estonia was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union in World War II, the status of the Estonian language changed to the first of two official languages (Russian being the other one). As with Latvia many immigrants entered Estonia under Soviet encouragement. In the second half of the 1970s, the pressure of bilingualism (for Estonians) intensified, resulting in widespread knowledge of Russian throughout the country. The Russian language was termed as ‘the language of friendship of nations’ and was taught to Estonian children, sometimes as early as in kindergarten. Although teaching Estonian to non-Estonians in schools was compulsory, in practice learning the language was often considered unnecessary.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer asserts that during WWII the Estonian language became the first of two official languages (the other being Russian). This is historically inaccurate; the two-official-language status was not established then. The Soviet era reforms culminated in the 1989 Law on the Status of the Estonian Language, and Estonia later promoted Estonian as the sole state language after independence. Therefore the Answer contains a factual inaccuracy regarding official language status.

Validation failed for title: Mesozoic.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How mild was the overall tectonic deformation in the Mesozoic compared to the Paleozoic?', 'question': 'You mentioned the Innuitian orogeny was related to tectonic processes. How mild was the overall tectonic deformation in the Mesozoic compared to the Paleozoic?', 'answer': 'Mesozoic tectonic deformation was comparatively mild compared to the vigorous convergent plate mountain-building of the late Paleozoic.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it relies on prior turns and mentions 'You mentioned...' and the Innuitian orogeny, which adds context not present in the rag_input. It therefore fails the requirement that the Question be a self-contained rephrasing of the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Mesozoic.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What else happened tectonically then?', 'question': 'If the Innuitian orogeny was the only major mountain-building event, what other significant tectonic activities occurred during the Mesozoic Era?', 'answer': 'Nevertheless, the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea. Pangaea gradually split into a northern continent, Laurasia, and a southern continent, Gondwana. This created the passive continental margin that characterizes most of the Atlantic coastline (such as along the U.S. East Coast) today.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. It introduces an external assumption about the Innuitian orogeny being the only major mountain-building event, which is not present in the RAG_input. A proper Question should restate the RAG_input in a self-contained form (e.g., 'What other tectonic events occurred during the Mesozoic era?'), without relying on prior context or asserting conditions not in the original prompt.

Validation failed for title: Materialism.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Does this mean it's always considered atheistic?", 'question': "According to the Catholic Encyclopedia's definition of materialism as a philosophical system regarding matter as the only reality, and thus denying God and the soul, is materialism always considered atheistic?", 'answer': 'In such a context one can conflate materialism with atheism.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer does not address whether materialism is always atheistic per the given definition; it only states that materialism can be conflated with atheism, which does not provide a definitive or standalone answer to the 'always' question.

Validation failed for title: Materialism.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about the relation to idealism?', 'question': 'Considering materialism is not necessarily atheistic, as previously discussed, what is the relationship between materialism and idealism?', 'answer': 'An argument for idealism, such as those of Hegel and Berkeley, is ipso facto an argument against materialism. Materialism belongs to the class of monist ontology. As such, it is different from ontological theories based on dualism or pluralism. For singular explanations of the phenomenal reality, materialism would be in contrast to idealism, neutral monism, and spiritualism. To idealists, spirit or mind or the objects of mind (ideas) are primary, and matter secondary. To materialists, matter is primary, and mind or spirit or ideas are secondary, the product of matter acting upon matter.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it includes the phrase 'as previously discussed,' which requires prior context. This violates the requirement that the Question be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Rule_of_law.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give an example of a country adhering to the formal definition, and one adhering to the substantive?', 'question': 'Based on the principal conceptions of the rule of law, formalist and substantive, can you provide an example of a country adhering to the formal definition and one adhering to the substantive definition?', 'answer': 'The document states that the formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights but recognizes the existence of "rule of law" in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights. So, a country with a strong emphasis on procedural law but potentially lacking individual rights protections might be an example of the formal definition, whereas a country with a constitution explicitly protecting individual rights would be an example of the substantive definition. The document does not name explicit countries matching those definitions.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The question requests concrete country examples illustrating formal (procedural-only) and substantive (rights-protecting) adherence. The provided answer gives generic descriptions and explicitly states that no explicit countries are named, which does not meet the requirement to provide actual examples.

Validation failed for title: Rule_of_law.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "If a country's legal system prioritizes economic development to attract foreign investors, does that lean more toward a formal or substantive application of the rule of law?", 'question': "Considering the formal and substantive definitions of the rule of law, if a country's legal system prioritizes economic development to attract foreign investors, does that lean more toward a formal or substantive application of the rule of law?", 'answer': 'It leans more toward a formal application. The document mentions that in countries like China and Vietnam, the transition to a market economy has been a major factor in moving toward the rule of law, because it is important to foreign investors and economic development. This suggests a focus on the procedural aspects (form) of the law to create a stable and predictable environment for investment, rather than necessarily guaranteeing substantive rights.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer asserts a formal (procedural) lean based on China and Vietnam, but the source text only states that moving toward the rule of law was driven by foreign investment and economic development; it does not specify whether the lean is formal or substantive. Therefore the answer does not align with the given RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Paper.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about coated paper? Does the coating affect yellowing?', 'question': 'Given that acid-free paper yellows less than paper with lignin, and that residual lignin, light exposure, and oxidation contribute to yellowing even in acid-free paper, does the coating on coated paper affect its propensity to yellow?', 'answer': 'Paper at this point is uncoated. Coated paper has a thin layer of material such as calcium carbonate or china clay applied to one or both sides in order to create a surface more suitable for high-resolution halftone screens. (Uncoated papers are rarely suitable for screens above 150 lpi.) Coated or uncoated papers may have their surfaces polished by calendering.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided 'Answer' does not address whether coating affects yellowing. It only describes what coated paper is and states that paper is uncoated, which is not universally true. It fails to connect coating properties to lignin oxidation, light exposure, or aging, and thus does not answer the RAG_input question.

Validation failed for title: Paper.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, if I'm understanding correctly, lignin is the biggest factor in yellowing, but coatings can mask or worsen the appearance. What about paper weight? Does thicker paper yellow less?", 'question': 'Given that lignin content is a primary factor in paper yellowing and that coatings can affect the visibility of yellowing, how does the weight or thickness of paper relate to its propensity to yellow?', 'answer': 'The weight of a ream therefore depends on the dimensions of the paper and its thickness. The thickness of paper is often measured by caliper, which is typically given in thousandths of an inch in the United States and in thousandths of a mm in the rest of the world. Paper may be between 0.07 and 0.18 millimetres (0.0028 and 0.0071 in) thick. The density of paper ranges from 250 kg/m3 (16 lb/cu ft) for tissue paper to 1,500 kg/m3 (94 lb/cu ft) for some speciality paper. Printing paper is about 800 kg/m3 (50 lb/cu ft).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided answer does not address how paper weight/thickness affects yellowing. It only states physical properties (caliper, density) and does not relate thickness or weight to lignin content, light exposure, or yellowing propensity.

Validation failed for title: Circadian_rhythm.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, if someone's SCN is destroyed, could you use external cues to synchronize those peripheral clocks?", 'question': 'Given that peripheral clocks can function independently but become desynchronized when the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is destroyed, is it possible to use external cues or interventions to help synchronize these peripheral clocks in the absence of the SCN?', 'answer': 'The document does not directly address whether external cues could synchronize peripheral clocks in the absence of the SCN.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer inappropriately cites 'The document' and thus breaks the rule of not mentioning that a document was provided. It should directly address whether external cues can synchronize peripheral clocks without referencing a document, and provide a standalone factual answer.

Validation failed for title: England_national_football_team.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who was managing them when they finished third in 1968?', 'question': "Given England's third-place finish in the 1968 UEFA European Football Championship, who was the manager of the England national football team at that time?", 'answer': 'The provided document does not mention who the manager was in 1968.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer is not correct. England's manager during the 1968 UEFA European Championship was Alf Ramsey; the response stating that the manager is not mentioned is incorrect.

Validation failed for title: England_national_football_team.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, they didn't actually finish third in 1968?", 'question': 'Based on the previous discussion, is it accurate to say that the England national football team finished third in the 1968 UEFA European Football Championship?', 'answer': 'No, England did not participate in the 1968 UEFA European Football Championship and therefore did not finish third.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it references 'the previous discussion' and thus requires prior context to understand. The specification requires the Question to be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input, without relying on history. The RAG_input itself is also somewhat ambiguous ('they'), but the primary failure is the non-standalone nature of the question.

Validation failed for title: Lancashire.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any folk artists particularly known for industrial songs?', 'question': "Following the discussion about Lancashire's folk music history and its artists, were there any folk artists particularly known for singing or collecting industrial folk songs from Lancashire?", 'answer': 'Yes, Harry Boardman was a local champion known for popularizing and recording the industrial folk song of Lancashire. The 20th-century folk revival also brought attention to the full range of song from the county, including industrial folk song.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The rag_input is too generic and not clearly tied to the prior Lancashire discussion. The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input, as it introduces Lancashire-specific context that isn’t present in the rag_input, violating the requirement that the Question be a standalone rephrase of the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Lancashire.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were clogs always worn, or were there variations?', 'question': 'Given our conversation about Lancashire clog dancing and its history, were clogs always the footwear used, or were there variations in the type of footwear worn for this dance?', 'answer': 'Clog dancing involves the use of clogs—wooden shoes with a thick sole that provide a firm, rhythmic footfall. The clogs were typically worn on the feet and were designed to be durable and sturdy, allowing dancers to perform complex footwork on hard, uneven surfaces like cobbled streets or dance floors.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrase of the RAG_input; it references prior conversation about Lancashire clog dancing, which violates the requirement that the Question be self-contained. Additionally, the Answer does not address whether there were variations in footwear (it only describes clogs generally), failing to directly answer the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Lancashire.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What other traditions were common during Wakes Week?', 'question': 'Besides clog dancing, what other traditions or activities were commonly observed during Wakes Week celebrations in Lancashire?', 'answer': 'The events were often tied to local customs and religious calendars, and they served as a social and cultural outlet for rural communities. Originally rooted in Christian liturgical practices, it was a time when communities would celebrate the end of the winter season and the return of spring. In medieval England, “wakes” were days of rest and festivity after a period of religious observance, and they evolved into seasonal celebrations involving music, dancing, and communal gatherings. In Lancashire, Wakes Week became especially vibrant in the 18th and 19th centuries, with towns and villages organizing processions, feasts, and celebrations.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrase of the rag_input: it adds 'Lancashire' and 'Besides clog dancing', introducing content not present in the rag_input and relying on prior context. For a valid test, the Question should be a self-contained restatement of the rag_input without referencing prior subtopics or specifics that aren’t in the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Lancashire.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What kind of music was typically played during rushbearing?', 'question': 'What type of music was typically played during rushbearing celebrations in Lancashire?', 'answer': 'The rushes are often carried by a group of people — sometimes children or young adults — and may be accompanied by music, dancing, or speeches. The event typically takes place during Wakes Week, though the exact timing and form vary by town.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question adds Lancashire-specific context not present in the rag_input, so it is not a faithful standalone rephrase. More importantly, the Answer does not specify what kind of music was played; it only states that music may accompany rushbearing, failing to answer the asked detail.

Validation failed for title: Old_English.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about the other two, Northumbrian and Kentish? Did they have any lasting impact?', 'question': 'Considering the four Old English dialects, and acknowledging the influences of West Saxon and Mercian, what lasting impact did the Northumbrian and Kentish dialects have on the development of English?', 'answer': 'The Kentish region, settled by the Jutes from Jutland, has the scantiest literary remains.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer only mentions Kentish and its limited literary remains, and does not address Northumbrian's lasting impact (e.g., its influence on Scots). It fails to answer the question about the two dialects together and is therefore incomplete.

Validation failed for title: Central_African_Republic.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who were Séléka?', 'question': "Following Michel Djotodia's takeover as president of the Central African Republic, who were the Séléka fighters that were involved in the renewed fighting?", 'answer': "The document does not specify who exactly the Séléka were, only that there was renewed fighting between them and Bozizé supporters after Djotodia's takeover.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document' and states it does not specify who the Séléka were, which violates the requirement to avoid referencing documents and to provide a self-contained, factual answer. The Answer should instead define who the Séléka were (e.g., a coalition of rebel groups active in the Central African Republic around 2013) rather than claiming a lack of specification.

Validation failed for title: Diarrhea.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about drinks high in sugar?', 'question': 'Are drinks high in sugar recommended for children under 5 years of age who have diarrhea?', 'answer': 'Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase dehydration.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input. The rag_input is the generic 'What about drinks high in sugar?', while the Question adds specific context ('for children under 5 years of age who have diarrhea'), which is not present in the rag_input and thus does not meet the requirement that the Question be a self-contained paraphrase of the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Diarrhea.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, homemade solutions are ok if they have the right balance?', 'question': 'Given that drinks high in sugar are not recommended for diarrhea, are homemade solutions acceptable if they contain a balanced amount of sugar and salt, like Oral Rehydration Solutions?', 'answer': 'Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the provided 'rag_input'. It introduces additional context about sugar recommendations and oral rehydration that is not present in the original rag_input, thus failing the requirement that the Question be a self-contained paraphrase of the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Diarrhea.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any foods to avoid besides sugary drinks?', 'question': 'Given that sugary drinks should be avoided when experiencing diarrhea, are there any other foods that should also be avoided?', 'answer': 'Diet restrictions such as the BRAT diet are no longer recommended. Research does not support the limiting of milk to children as doing so has no effect on duration of diarrhea.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone paraphrase of the 'rag_input'. It adds context about diarrhea and phrasing that assumes prior discussion, which violates the requirement that the Question be a self-contained restatement identical in spirit to the rag_input for the first turn.

Validation failed for title: Phonology.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's an example of a minimal pair in a language where aspiration *does* change the meaning?", 'question': "Given the example of aspiration in English where it doesn't change the meaning, what would be an example of a minimal pair in a different language where aspiration *does* differentiate the meaning of words?", 'answer': 'In Thai, Hindi, and Quechua, there are minimal pairs of words for which aspiration is the only contrasting feature.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer does not provide a concrete minimal pair example; it only states that Thai, Hindi, and Quechua have minimal pairs where aspiration differentiates meaning, but does not present an explicit two-word pair in any language as requested.

Validation failed for title: Phonology.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, the Quechua example is the only one in the document that actually fits the criteria of a minimal pair where aspiration is the only difference?', 'question': "Based on the previous discussion about aspiration and minimal pairs, and acknowledging that the original document did not provide clear examples, is the Quechua example of 'k'aq' and 'kʰaq' the only one that clearly fits the criteria of being a minimal pair where the presence or absence of aspiration is the sole distinguishing factor?", 'answer': "The document only mentions the existence of minimal pairs in those languages but doesn't provide specific examples.", 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The input violates the RAG_input rule by referencing 'the document' and claiming it contains examples. The RAG_input must be self-contained and not mention any document source. Consequently, the accompanying Question is not a standalone rephrasing (it references 'the original document'), and the Answer relies on document context rather than being self-contained. Overall, the required standalone, document-free framing is not met.

Validation failed for title: Great_power.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Then what differentiates a great power from a superpower?', 'question': 'Given that a great power is defined by its global influence and may not necessarily require a strong military, what characteristics distinguish a great power from a superpower?', 'answer': 'Since the end of the World Wars, the term "great power" has been joined by a number of other power classifications. Foremost among these is the concept of the superpower, used to describe those nations with overwhelming power and influence in the rest of the world. It was first coined in 1944 by William T.R. Fox and according to him, there were three superpowers: the British Empire, the United States, and the Soviet Union. But by the mid-1950s the British Empire lost its superpower status, leaving the United States and the Soviet Union as the world\'s superpowers.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The answer asserts there were three superpowers (the British Empire, the United States, and the Soviet Union) and that the British Empire lost superpower status by the mid-1950s. Most scholarship recognizes only the United States and the Soviet Union as the two superpowers after WWII; the UK is typically treated as a great power, not a superpower. This misstates the core distinction and relies on a contested historical claim.

Validation failed for title: Spanish_language_in_the_United_States.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Why did so many Puerto Ricans move to the mainland?', 'question': 'Why did so many Puerto Ricans move to the U.S. mainland, considering they are natural-born U.S. citizens?', 'answer': 'Many Puerto Ricans have migrated to New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, and other areas of the Eastern United States, increasing the Spanish-speaking populations and in some areas being the majority of the Hispanophone population, especially in Central Florida.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the 'why' of the migration. It lists destinations (cities/regions) and demographic effects rather than explaining the economic, political, or social factors that motivated Puerto Ricans to move to the U.S. mainland.

Validation failed for title: Spanish_language_in_the_United_States.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does the Cuban migration to Florida compare?', 'question': 'Considering the history of Puerto Rican migration to the US mainland, how does the Cuban migration to Florida compare in terms of reasons and language retention?', 'answer': "Immigration to the United States of Spanish-speaking Cubans began because of Cuba's political instability upon achieving independence. The deposition of Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship and the ascension of Fidel Castro's government in 1959 increased Cuban immigration to the United States, hence there are some one million Cubans in the United States, most settled in southern and central Florida, while other Cubans live in the Northeastern United States; most are fluent in Spanish. In the city of Miami today Spanish is the first language mostly due to Cuban immigration.", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone/self-contained; it presumes knowledge of Puerto Rican migration history and asks for a comparison that relies on that context, which is not provided in the rag_input. It should be self-contained and not rely on prior turns.

Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did other Spanish-speaking groups migrate to the US for political reasons?', 'question': 'Besides Cubans migrating to Florida due to political instability, did other significant Spanish-speaking groups migrate to the United States primarily for political reasons, and if so, which groups and what were their circumstances?', 'answer': 'As civil wars engulfed several Central American countries in the 1980s, hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans fled their country and came to the United States. Likewise the migration of Spanish-speaking Nicaraguans also began as a result of political instability during the end of the 1970s and the 1980s. The uprising of the Sandinista revolution which toppled the Somoza dictatorship in 1979 caused many Nicaraguans to migrate particularly from those opposing the Sandinistas. Throughout the 1980s with the United States supported Contra War (or Contra-revolutionary war) which continued up until 1988, and the economic collapse of the country many more Nicaraguans migrated to the United States amongst other countries.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it relies on prior context about Cuban migration (it mentions 'Besides Cubans...'), and therefore does not rephrase the rag_input independently as required.

Validation failed for title: Spanish_language_in_the_United_States.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did people from Mexico ever move to the US for political reasons?', 'question': 'Aside from Cubans, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, and Venezuelans, did people from Mexico ever migrate to the United States primarily because of political issues in Mexico?', 'answer': 'After the Mexican War of Independence from Spain also, California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, western Colorado and southwestern Wyoming became part of the Mexican territory of Alta California and most of New Mexico, western Texas, southern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and Oklahoma panhandle were part of the territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo México.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question does not faithfully rephrase the RAG_input as a standalone query (it adds an ‘Aside from Cubans, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, and Venezuelans’ comparison that isn’t present in the original). The Answer is not factual or relevant to the RAG_input/Question, as it discusses Mexican territorial history (Alta California, Santa Fe de Nuevo México) rather than migration reasons, and does not address whether Mexicans migrated to the U.S. for political reasons.

Validation failed for title: Georgian_architecture.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did this tax affect internal layouts as well?', 'question': 'The window tax affected window design in Georgian architecture. Did this tax also have an impact on the internal layouts of buildings?', 'answer': 'Before this the internal plan and function of the rooms can generally not be deduced from the outside.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The rag_input asks whether the window tax affected internal layouts. The provided Question does not rephrase this topic correctly; it shifts to window design and adds unrelated context about classical orders. The Answer does not directly address whether internal layouts were affected. Therefore, the Q/A pair fails the requirements for a context-consistent, standalone Question and a relevant, correct Answer.

Validation failed for title: Georgian_architecture.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were materials also affected by the tax, or just window size and placement?', 'question': 'Given that the window tax influenced window size, placement, and internal layouts in Georgian architecture, did it also affect the choice of building materials used during that period?', 'answer': 'American buildings of the Georgian period were very often constructed of wood with clapboards; even columns were made of timber, framed up, and turned on an over-sized lathe. At the start of the period the difficulties of obtaining and transporting brick or stone made them a common alternative only in the larger cities, or where they were obtainable locally.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer references American Georgian construction as if governed by the window tax (a UK policy) and does not address whether materials in Georgian architecture were affected by the tax. It fails to provide a correct, relevant answer to the question and introduces an unrelated regional example.

Validation failed for title: Swaziland.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is that percentage increasing or decreasing?', 'question': 'Is the percentage of people employed in subsistence agriculture on Swazi Nation Land (SNL) increasing or decreasing?', 'answer': "Declining productivity subsistence agriculture (on SNL) may well explain the country's overall low growth, high inequality and unemployment.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address whether the percentage is increasing or decreasing. The question requires a clear statement about the trend (e.g., increasing or decreasing). The provided answer discusses reasons for low growth and inequality instead of stating the trend.

Validation failed for title: Swaziland.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are some of the alternative livelihoods?', 'question': 'Given the decline in agricultural employment in Eswatini, what are some of the alternative livelihoods people are moving towards?', 'answer': "Swaziland's major overseas trading partners are the United States and the European Union. The majority of the country's employment is provided by its agricultural and manufacturing sectors. Textile exports grew by over 200% between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50% over the same period.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The rag_input is not contextually connected to the prior turn and does not clearly build on Eswatini context; The Question is not a standalone rephrase of the rag_input. The Answer is not relevant to the question about alternative livelihoods, as it discusses trading partners and export growth rather than livelihoods.

Validation failed for title: Swaziland.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is the textile industry still growing at the same rate as 2000-2005?', 'question': 'Considering that textile exports in Eswatini grew significantly between 2000 and 2005, is the textile industry currently experiencing a similar rate of growth, or has the growth rate changed?', 'answer': "The Swazi economy is very closely linked to the economy of South Africa, from which it receives over 90% of its imports and to which it sends about 70% of its exports. Swaziland's other key trading partners are the United States and the EU, from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports (under the African Growth and Opportunity Act – AGOA – to the US) and for sugar (to the EU).", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address whether the textile industry's growth rate is the same as 2000-2005 or has changed; it discusses trade partners and AGOA rather than the growth trend itself.

Validation failed for title: Translation.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did this compare to Arabic translation efforts during the same period?', 'question': "How did the Tangut Empire's translation efforts compare to Arabic translation efforts during the 10th to 13th centuries, considering the scale, speed, and support?", 'answer': 'The Arabs undertook large-scale efforts at translation. Having conquered the Greek world, they made Arabic versions of its philosophical and scientific works. During the Middle Ages, translations of some of these Arabic versions were made into Latin, chiefly at Córdoba in Spain. King Alfonso X el Sabio (Alphonse the Wise) of Castille in the 13th century promoted this effort by founding a Schola Traductorum (School of Translation) in Toledo. There Arabic texts, Hebrew texts, and Latin texts were translated into the other tongues by Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars, who also argued the merits of their respective religions. Latin translations of Greek and original Arab works of scholarship and science helped advance European Scholasticism, and thus European science and culture. Translation of material into Arabic expanded after the creation of Arabic script in the 5th century, and gained great importance with the rise of Islam and Islamic empires. Arab translation initially focused primarily on politics, rendering Persian, Greek, even Chinese and Indic diplomatic materials into Arabic. It later focused on translating classical Greek and Persian works, as well as some Chinese and Indian texts, into Arabic for scholarly study at major Islamic learning centers, such as the Al-Karaouine (Fes, Morocco), Al-Azhar (Cairo, Egypt), and the Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad. In terms of theory, Arabic translation drew heavily on earlier Near Eastern traditions as well as more contemporary Greek and Persian traditions.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input. It should be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input, including necessary context but not the exact same text.

Validation failed for title: Translation.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, if the Arabic translations heavily influenced Europe, what specific texts or areas of knowledge benefited the most from this transmission?', 'question': 'Given that Arabic translations significantly influenced Europe between the 8th and 13th centuries, as opposed to the Tangut translations which did not survive, can you specify which particular texts or areas of knowledge in Europe were most profoundly impacted by this transmission of knowledge from the Arabic world?', 'answer': 'Latin translations of Greek and original Arab works of scholarship and science helped advance European Scholasticism, and thus European science and culture.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not specify particular texts or knowledge areas as the question requests; it is too generic and lacks concrete examples (e.g., Aristotle's works, Euclid's Elements, Galen/Avicenna, astronomical and medical texts). Additionally, the Question introduces Tangut context not present in the rag_input, which deviates from a standalone rephrase of the original prompt.

Validation failed for title: Translation.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any notable translation errors or misinterpretations that arose during the transmission of these texts from Arabic to Latin, and what impact did they have?', 'question': 'Considering the significant influence of Arabic translations on European scholarship, particularly in philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine during the 12th to 14th centuries, were there any significant translation errors or misinterpretations that occurred during the process of translating these texts from Arabic to Latin, and what consequences or impacts did these errors have on the reception and understanding of these subjects in Europe?', 'answer': 'Comparison of a back-translation with the original text is sometimes used as a check on the accuracy of the original translation, much as the accuracy of a mathematical operation is sometimes checked by reversing the operation. But the results of such reverse-translation operations, while useful as approximate checks, are not always precisely reliable. Back-translation must in general be less accurate than back-calculation because linguistic symbols (words) are often ambiguous, whereas mathematical symbols are intentionally unequivocal.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the stand-alone Question about notable translation errors/misinterpretations in Arabic-to-Latin transmission and their impacts. Instead, it discusses back-translation as a verification method, which is not a direct answer to the posed question.

Validation failed for title: Translation.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did these errors disproportionately affect any particular field, like philosophy versus medicine, and if so, why?', 'question': 'Considering the various translation errors and misinterpretations that influenced European thought between the 12th and 14th centuries, such as distortions in philosophical concepts, misinterpretations of mathematical terms, and omissions in scientific texts, did these errors have a disproportionately larger impact on any specific academic field, like philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, or medicine, compared to others, and if such a disparity existed, what were the underlying reasons for this uneven distribution of impact?', 'answer': 'Latin translations of Greek and original Arab works of scholarship and science helped advance European Scholasticism, and thus European science and culture.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not answer the standalone Question. The Question asks whether translation errors had a disproportionately larger impact on specific fields (e.g., philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, medicine) and why; the Answer only states a general impact of Latin translations on Scholasticism and European science, without addressing field-specific disparities or providing causal explanations.

Validation failed for title: Neolithic.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did they farm?', 'question': 'Did the Halaf culture farm?', 'answer': 'Yes, the Halaf culture subsisted on dryland agriculture.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to 'rag_input' (it should be a standalone rephrase, not identical). Additionally, the required 'Type' field is missing; for a Follow-up it should be 'Follow-up'.

Validation failed for title: Neolithic.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did Neolithic societies generally compare to Paleolithic cultures regarding hierarchy?', 'question': 'Given the discussion about the Halaf culture and their potential egalitarianism, how did Neolithic societies generally differ from Paleolithic cultures in terms of social hierarchy, according to the information available?', 'answer': 'However, most Neolithic societies were noticeably more hierarchical than the Paleolithic cultures that preceded them and hunter-gatherer cultures in general.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrase of the rag_input. It introduces external context ('Given the discussion about the Halaf culture...') that relies on prior conversation, which violates the requirement for a self-contained question. The rag_input itself is generic and should be rephrased without referencing prior discussion.

Validation failed for title: Grape.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, are purple grapes always better for making red wine?', 'question': 'Given that purple grapes contain anthocyanins and have a higher phenolic content than white grapes, are purple grapes always better for making red wine?', 'answer': 'Red wine may offer health benefits more so than white because potentially beneficial compounds are present in grape skin, and only red wine is fermented with skins. The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its resveratrol content. Ordinary non-muscadine red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg/L, depending on the grape variety, because it is fermented with the skins, allowing the wine to absorb the resveratrol.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is not identical to the 'rag_input' as required for the first turn; they should be exact copies. Additionally, the 'Answer' does not directly address whether purple grapes are always better for making red wine, instead focusing on resveratrol and skin-contact effects rather than the core comparison implied by the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Grape.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned Pinot Noir and Syrah as good red wine grapes. What makes them so special compared to other purple grapes?', 'question': 'Given that purple grapes are necessary for red wine but the quality of the wine depends on many factors beyond just the grape variety, and Pinot Noir and Syrah were mentioned as examples of good red wine grapes, what makes Pinot Noir and Syrah so special compared to other purple grapes in winemaking?', 'answer': 'Phenolic content of grape skin varies with cultivar, soil composition, climate, geographic origin, and cultivation practices or exposure to diseases, such as fungal infections.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not directly address what makes Pinot Noir and Syrah special compared to other purple grapes; it provides a generic statement about phenolic content variation rather than comparing the two varieties or detailing their specific winemaking characteristics (e.g., Pinot Noir's delicate tannins and acidity, thin skins vs Syrah's thicker skins, color, tannin structure, and flavor profile).

Validation failed for title: Grape.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, if climate is so important, are there any grapes that are less sensitive to it?', 'question': 'Given that Pinot Noir is particularly sensitive to climate and that both Pinot Noir and Syrah are affected by terroir, are there any grape varieties that are less sensitive to climate compared to Pinot Noir?', 'answer': 'Phenolic content of grape skin varies with cultivar, soil composition, climate, geographic origin, and cultivation practices or exposure to diseases, such as fungal infections.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not an identical rephrase of 'rag_input' as required for the first turn (rag_input asks about grape varieties less sensitive to climate; the Question adds context about Pinot Noir and terroir and alters the direct framing). Additionally, the 'Answer' does not directly address the question about climate sensitivity differences among grape varieties, making it factually incorrect relative to the prompt.

Validation failed for title: Grape.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, could Zinfandel ever be used to make a wine similar to Pinot Noir?', 'question': 'Given that Zinfandel is highly resilient in warm climates and Pinot Noir is extremely sensitive to climate, could Zinfandel ever be used to make a wine that is similar in style and characteristics to Pinot Noir?', 'answer': 'Phenolic content of grape skin varies with cultivar, soil composition, climate, geographic origin, and cultivation practices or exposure to diseases, such as fungal infections.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the rag_input/Question. It provides a generic statement about phenolic content variation rather than a direct assessment of whether Zinfandel could produce a wine similar in style to Pinot Noir.

Validation failed for title: Genome.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Regarding transposable elements in eukaryotes, which class is more prevalent?', 'question': 'Based on our discussion about repetitive DNA and transposable elements in eukaryotes, which class of transposable elements (Class 1 or Class 2) is generally more prevalent in eukaryotic genomes?', 'answer': 'The document does not specify which class is more prevalent.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references 'our discussion' which makes it non-self-contained and not usable without prior context. The rag_input should be context-rich but the Question must be self-contained. Additionally, the Answer is not factually correct or informative for the prompt, as it asserts lack of specification instead of providing a valid classification or rationale (e.g., which class is generally more prevalent, with caveats).

Validation failed for title: Genome.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, transposase is key for DNA transposon movement. What's the equivalent enzyme for retrotransposons?", 'question': 'Given that transposase is essential for the movement of DNA transposons, what is the name and function of the corresponding enzyme that facilitates the movement and integration of retrotransposons?', 'answer': 'Retrotransposons can be transcribed into RNA, which are then duplicated at another site into the genome.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided Answer does not name the enzyme responsible for retrotransposon movement (reverse transcriptase, and in many cases integrase as well). It also inadequately describes the mechanism, mentioning 'transcribed into RNA' and 'duplicated' rather than outlining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA and subsequent integration into the genome.

Validation failed for title: Hanover.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Tell me more about the Jewish community in Hanover during that time.', 'question': "You mentioned the persecution of the Jewish community and a memorial at Opera Square. Can you provide more details about the Jewish community in Hanover during World War II and the events that led to the memorial's creation?", 'answer': 'In September 1941, through the "Action Lauterbacher" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it relies on prior conversation (mentions 'You mentioned...' and a 'memorial at Opera Square'), which violates the requirement that it be a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Hanover.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What was the 'Action Lauterbacher' plan?", 'question': "You mentioned a plan called 'Action Lauterbacher' that affected Jewish families in Hanover in 1941. What was the purpose and specific actions taken under this plan?", 'answer': 'In September 1941, through the "Action Lauterbacher" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided 'Question' is not standalone: it references prior conversation with 'You mentioned...' and thus relies on context, violating the requirement that the Question be self-contained. Additionally, the 'Answer' only notes that ghettoisation began, which does not address the stated prompt to explain the plan's purpose and specific actions (it is incomplete).

Validation failed for title: Comprehensive_school.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, was her impact generally seen as positive for the comprehensive system at the time?', 'question': 'Margaret Thatcher ended the compulsion for local authorities to convert to comprehensive schools, yet more comprehensive schools were established under her than any other education secretary. Given this context, was her impact generally seen as positive for the comprehensive system at the time?', 'answer': "It's difficult to say if her impact was generally seen as positive. She ended mandatory conversion, but comprehensive schools still expanded under her. The document does not provide public sentiment.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not identical to the rag_input. In the required first turn, Question must be exactly the same as rag_input; here it adds extra context and differs wording, failing the stated format.

Validation failed for title: Comprehensive_school.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did these regional differences in perception affect the long-term funding or resources allocated to comprehensive schools in those areas?', 'question': "Given that the perception of Margaret Thatcher's impact on comprehensive schools varied by region, did these regional differences in perception affect the long-term funding or resources allocated to comprehensive schools in those areas?", 'answer': 'The document does not address the long-term funding or resource allocation to comprehensive schools based on regional perceptions.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document', which violates the rule to never mention that a document was provided. It should respond directly to the RAG_input/Question without citing a document, and if the information is unavailable, state that instead of referencing a document.

Validation failed for title: Central_Intelligence_Agency.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So it doesn't partner with the National Intelligence University?", 'question': 'Are you saying that, contrary to the previous statement that CIA University partners with the National Intelligence University, that CIA University does not have a formal partnership with the National Intelligence University?', 'answer': 'CIA University works in partnership with the National Intelligence University.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: Rule 2 violation: The 'Question' is not standalone. It references 'the previous statement' and presupposes prior dialogue, rather than being a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input. A standalone question should restate the issue without requiring past context.

Validation failed for title: Data_compression.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there specific editing programs that work better with interframe, or is it generally a bad idea across the board?', 'question': 'Given that interframe compression is generally considered less suitable for video editing due to frame dependencies, are there any specific video editing programs that are better equipped to handle interframe-compressed video, or is it generally a problematic format to edit regardless of the software used?', 'answer': "The documents don't directly mention specific editing programs that handle interframe compression better than others. However, they do imply that while interframe compression presents challenges for editing, it is widely used in video standards. Therefore, modern video editing software is likely to have features to mitigate these issues, such as frame interpolation or advanced decoding capabilities, but the fundamental difficulties related to frame dependency remain.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references retrieval/document context (e.g., 'The documents don't directly mention...'), which violates the rule to avoid mentioning that a document was provided. The response should be a self-contained answer without referring to sources, and still address whether any editing programs are better with interframe compression.

Validation failed for title: Data_compression.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any downsides to using proxy files, like a loss of quality when converting back to the original?', 'question': 'Given that proxy workflows involve converting video to an intraframe format for easier editing before potentially exporting back to the original interframe format, are there any potential drawbacks to this approach, such as a loss of quality incurred during the conversion process?', 'answer': 'The document does not explicitly state that there is a loss of quality when converting back to the original. However, it does note that the proxy is often lower resolution, implying that some data is lost in creating the proxy. Converting back to the original will not restore that lost data.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references a document (e.g., 'The document does not explicitly state...'), which violates the rule to avoid mentioning that a document was provided. It should be a self-contained statement about proxy workflows without referencing sources.

Validation failed for title: Exhibition_game.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any rules about who they can play in those preseason games?', 'question': 'Following the previous discussion about exhibition games in the NFL, are there any rules about which teams NFL teams are allowed to play in their preseason games?', 'answer': 'The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it references 'the previous discussion' and thus relies on prior history. A valid question should be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input, understandable without any history or references to past turns.

Validation failed for title: Exhibition_game.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Why were split-squad games prohibited?', 'question': 'Following our discussion about rules for NFL preseason games, what were the reasons that the NFL prohibited teams from playing split-squad games during the preseason?', 'answer': 'Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' references 'Following our discussion...' which ties it to prior history, making it not a standalone rephrase of the RAG_input. Additionally, the 'Answer' merely restates that split-squad games are prohibited and does not provide the actual reasons behind the prohibition, failing the requirement to deliver the ground-truth answer to the standalone question.

Validation failed for title: Federal_Aviation_Administration.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was this change well-received?', 'question': 'In 2014, the FAA changed its approach to air traffic control candidates to increase flight traffic controller racial diversity by eliminating preferences based on training and experience. Was this change well-received?', 'answer': "The document doesn't explicitly state if the change was 'well-received' in general, but it does mention that applicants found the biographical questionnaire baffling, suggesting some level of dissatisfaction or difficulty with the new process.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is not context-rich and does not clearly build on the prior turn. It should reference the specific 2014 FAA change and its reception rather than a vague 'this change'.

Validation failed for title: Federal_Aviation_Administration.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Besides the questionnaire, what else changed in the air traffic control candidate selection process in 2014?', 'question': 'In 2014, the FAA changed its approach to air traffic control candidates. We know a biographical questionnaire was introduced. Besides the questionnaire, what other specific aspects of the air traffic control candidate selection process changed that year?', 'answer': "In 2014, the FAA eliminated preferences based on training and experience at flight schools in favor of a personality test open to anyone irrespective of experience. The agency eliminated the 'fast-tracked' consideration for candidates who had completed coursework at participating colleges and universities and switched to an open system to the general public, with no need for any experience or even a college degree.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer incorrectly describes the 2014 FAA change as introducing a 'personality test' instead of a biographical questionnaire. The change eliminated preferences based on training/experience and the fast-track option, switching to an open system with a biographical questionnaire. The term 'personality test' is not supported by the provided context, making the answer partially incorrect.

Validation failed for title: Southern_Europe.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which countries are considered part of Southern Europe by the United Nations?', 'question': 'Which countries are considered part of Southern Europe by the United Nations?', 'answer': 'According to the United Nations, Southern Europe includes the following countries and territories.'}
Reason: Requirement 3 violated: The answer does not provide the actual list of countries; it only states that the UN includes certain countries and territories. The question requires naming which countries are considered part of Southern Europe by the UN, which is not fulfilled by the given answer.

Validation failed for title: Southern_Europe.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned that Albanian is a language isolate. What exactly does that mean?', 'question': 'Following the discussion about languages spoken in Southern Europe and their relationship to languages outside of Europe, you mentioned that Albanian is a language isolate. What exactly does that mean in the context of language families?', 'answer': 'A language isolate is a language with no demonstrable genetic relationship to any other known language. This means that it cannot be classified into any established language family.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer is not factually correct: Albanian is not considered a language isolate in mainstream linguistics; it is generally classified as its own branch within the Indo-European language family. The provided definition incorrectly labels Albanian as having no genetic relationship to other languages.

Validation failed for title: Southern_Europe.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'If Albanian is considered an isolate, how did it develop its vocabulary and grammar?', 'question': 'Considering that Albanian is often classified as a language isolate with debated links to other families, how did the Albanian language independently develop its specific vocabulary and grammatical structures over time?', 'answer': 'The language appears to have evolved in relative isolation in the Balkans, possibly from a pre-Indo-European substrate or from an unknown, now-extinct language.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer states Albanian evolved in relative isolation as a pre-Indo-European substrate or from an extinct language. The mainstream ground-truth is that Albanian is an Indo-European language, forming its own branch within IE, not a language isolate. A correct answer would describe Albanian's development within the Indo-European context and discuss substrate influences and contact, rather than claiming isolation.

Validation failed for title: Imperial_College_London.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's the Henley Royal Regatta?", 'question': 'You mentioned the Henley Royal Regatta. What is it?', 'answer': 'The club has been highly successful, with many wins at Henley Royal Regatta including most recently in 2013 with victory in The Prince Albert Challenge Cup event.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule 2 is violated: the Question is not a standalone rephrasing of rag_input (it references prior conversation with 'You mentioned') and isn’t self-contained. Additionally, Rule 4 is violated: the Answer should define what the Henley Royal Regatta is; the given answer describes a club's achievements rather than explaining the event itself.

Validation failed for title: Imperial_College_London.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What other clubs does Imperial College have?', 'question': 'Besides the boat club, what other clubs are associated with Imperial College?', 'answer': 'The Union also hosts sports-related clubs such as Imperial College Boat Club and Imperial College Gliding Club.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the prompt correctly: it repeats the boat club and does not provide other clubs beyond the boat club (e.g., Imperial College Gliding Club). It should name the other clubs rather than referencing the Boat Club again.

Validation failed for title: Imperial_College_London.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Tell me more about Project Nepal.', 'question': 'What is Project Nepal at Imperial College?', 'answer': 'Project Nepal which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development programmes in rural Nepal', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer is not a complete sentence and does not provide a standalone, clearly defined description of Project Nepal. It reads as a fragment ('Project Nepal which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development programmes in rural Nepal') rather than a full sentence. For Rule 4, it should be: 'Project Nepal is a program at Imperial College London that sends students to rural Nepal to work on educational development projects.'

Validation failed for title: Christian.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is that percentage growing or shrinking?', 'question': "Based on the provided information, is the percentage of the world's population that is Christian growing or shrinking?", 'answer': "According to 2012 Pew Research Center survey if current trends continue, Christianity will remains the world's largest religion by year 2050. By 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion. While Muslims have an average of 3.1 children per woman—the highest rate of all religious groups. Christians are second, with 2.7 children per woman. High birth rates and conversion were cited as the reason for the Christian population growths.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer discusses absolute population growth and projections, not the change in the percentage share of Christians in the world population. The question asks whether the percentage is growing or shrinking; the provided answer should state if the share is increasing, decreasing, or stable, with justification. It does not clearly answer the question and may mislead by equating growth in numbers with growth in share.

Validation failed for title: Intellectual_property.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So the research exception in the US is very limited, what about for copyright?', 'question': 'Given that the research exception for patent infringement in the US is very limited, what are the limitations and exceptions to copyright infringement in the US?', 'answer': 'There are limitations and exceptions to copyright, allowing limited use of copyrighted works, which does not constitute infringement. Examples of such doctrines are the fair use and fair dealing doctrine.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question does not faithfully rephrase the rag_input as a standalone follow-up; it introduces patent infringement context that is not in the original rag_input, altering the scope. Additionally, the Answer asserts 'fair dealing' as an US copyright doctrine, which is inaccurate (the US primarily relies on 'fair use'; 'fair dealing' is used in other jurisdictions).

Validation failed for title: Intellectual_property.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give me an example of fair use?', 'question': 'Based on the discussion of fair use in US copyright law, what would be an example of a situation that would qualify as fair use?', 'answer': 'Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted works, which does not constitute infringement.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a faithful standalone rephrase of the rag_input: it adds a dependency on a prior discussion by saying "Based on the discussion" which makes it not self-contained. More importantly, the Answer does not provide a concrete example of fair use; it gives a generic statement about fair use instead of an actual example, failing to satisfy the requirement that the Answer illustrate a specific fair use scenario.

Validation failed for title: Intellectual_property.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What if that professor was at a for-profit university?', 'question': 'Considering the example of the professor using a short passage from a book in a classroom lecture, how would the fair use analysis change if the professor were teaching at a for-profit university rather than a non-profit one?', 'answer': 'The purpose and character of the use (e.g., commercial vs. non-profit, educational vs. for profit) is one of the four factors courts consider in determining fair use', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer does not explain how the fair use analysis would change with a for-profit university; it only notes that 'purpose and character' is a factor, without stating the directional impact (e.g., whether the for-profit context would weigh against fair use or how it interacts with educational intent).

Validation failed for title: Clothing.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there regulations regarding formaldehyde in clothing?', 'question': 'Following the concern about formaldehyde in non-wrinkle shirts potentially causing contact dermatitis, are there any regulations in place to control the amount of formaldehyde used in clothing manufacturing?', 'answer': 'No disclosure requirements exist.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is identical to the 'rag_input'; per the rules, the Question should be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input (self-contained) and not identical to it.

Validation failed for title: Clothing.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Does washing help reduce the formaldehyde?', 'question': 'Since there are no regulations on formaldehyde in clothing, does washing the clothing help to reduce the amount of formaldehyde present?', 'answer': 'In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a proper standalone rephrase of the RAG_input. It adds regulatory context ('there are no regulations on formaldehyde in clothing') that is not in the original RAG_input, and the wording does not faithfully restate the prompt 'Does washing help reduce the formaldehyde?' in a self-contained manner.

Validation failed for title: Transistor.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Why not?', 'question': 'Given that BGAs are used for large integrated circuits and not discrete transistors, what are the reasons or limitations that prevent BGAs from being used with discrete transistors?', 'answer': 'The document does not explicitly state why BGAs are not used for discrete transistors. However, it implies that the size and complexity of BGAs are more suited for large integrated circuits, while discrete transistors, being simpler and smaller, can utilize other surface-mount packages. Additionally, the document mentions that SMDs have better high-frequency characteristics due to their smaller size and shorter interconnections. Using a BGA package might negate some of those advantages for discrete transistors.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document' and states 'The document does not explicitly state...', which violates the rule 'Never mention that a document was provided.' The response should be self-contained reasoning without referring to any document or retrieval source.

Validation failed for title: Internet_service_provider.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any benefits to using a VISP instead of a regular ISP?', 'question': 'Given the difference between a VISP, which resells internet access, and a traditional ISP, which owns its infrastructure, are there any advantages for a customer to choose a VISP over a regular ISP?', 'answer': 'The document does not explicitly state the benefits of using a VISP over a regular ISP. However, it implies that VISPs allow smaller companies or new entrants to offer Internet services without the massive upfront cost of building their own network.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer claims there are no explicit benefits and even refers to a 'document'—violating the rule to be self-contained. The provided context indicates a clear benefit: VISPs allow smaller entrants to offer Internet services without the massive upfront cost of building their own network.

Validation failed for title: Gregorian_calendar.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, dual dating was only used when countries switched calendars?', 'question': 'Was dual dating only used when countries switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar?', 'answer': 'No, dual dating was also used even before 1582 because of the different beginnings of the year in various countries.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input. According to the rules, the Question must be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input (self-contained and not identical to it).

Validation failed for title: Gregorian_calendar.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What determined the specific date that countries switched?', 'question': 'When countries decided to switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, what factors or considerations determined the specific date on which they made that switch?', 'answer': 'Philip II of Spain decreed the change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, which affected much of Roman Catholic Europe, as Philip was at the time ruler over Spain and Portugal as well as much of Italy. In these territories, as well as in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (ruled by Anna Jagiellon) and in the Papal States, the new calendar was implemented on the date specified by the bull, with Julian Thursday, 4 October 1582, being followed by Gregorian Friday, 15 October 1582. The Spanish and Portuguese colonies followed somewhat later de facto because of delay in communication.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer incorrectly centers the switch date on Philip II's decree. In reality, the date was set by the papal bull Inter gravissimas and adopted by each country at different times for various reasons (political, administrative readiness, and communication delays). Not all Catholic regions switched on the same date, and the determinants include the papal calendar reform plus the practical and diplomatic process of implementation across states.

Validation failed for title: Gregorian_calendar.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did the leap day factor into all of this?', 'question': 'During the switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, and considering that both calendars had leap years, how was the leap day handled in the transition?', 'answer': 'In the Julian calendar a leap year occurs every 4 years, but the Gregorian calendar omits 3 leap days every 400 years. In the Julian calendar, this leap day was inserted by doubling 24 February, and the Gregorian reform did not change the date of the leap day. In the modern period, it has become customary to number the days from the beginning of the month, and February 29th is often considered as the leap day. Some churches, notably the Roman Catholic Church, delay February festivals after the 23rd by one day in leap years.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The leap day handling description is incorrect. The 1582 transition did not involve 'doubling 24 February'; it skipped 10 days in October (Julian Oct 4 → Gregorian Oct 15) and February’s leap-day rules were not applied or altered as part of that switch. In 1582, neither calendar had a Feb 29, since 1582 is not a leap year in either system. The Gregorian reform’s leap-year rule (omitting 3 of 4 centurial leap years) is a long-term adjustment, not a local October transition.

Validation failed for title: Canon_law.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Could you compare this to the Anglican Communion?', 'question': "Given the discussion of enforcement of 'practice and procedure' within Presbyterian churches, can you compare the enforcement mechanisms with those found in the Anglican Communion?", 'answer': 'Currently, (2004), there are principles of canon law common to the churches within the Anglican Communion; their existence can be factually established; each province or church contributes through its own legal system to the principles of canon law common within the Communion; these principles have a strong persuasive authority and are fundamental to the self-understanding of each of the churches of the Communion; these principles have a living force, and contain in themselves the possibility of further development; and the existence of these principles both demonstrates unity and promotes unity within the Anglican Communion.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The rag_input is too vague and relies on prior context: 'Could you compare this to the Anglican Communion?' does not clearly specify what 'this' refers to. It fails the standalone/context requirement for RAG_input, which should clearly build on prior turns without relying on explicit history. The Question tries to be standalone by referencing 'enforcement of practice and procedure within Presbyterian churches,' but the rag_input itself does not clearly encode that context. The Type and Answer are acceptable, but the overall input does not fully satisfy the required criteria.

Validation failed for title: Canon_law.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does this lack of civil binding force affect the power of the ecclesiastical courts?', 'question': 'Given that the ecclesiastical courts in the Church of England lack civil binding force, how does this limitation specifically impact their practical authority and influence?', 'answer': 'In the Church of England, the ecclesiastical courts that formerly decided many matters such as disputes relating to marriage, divorce, wills, and defamation, still have jurisdiction of certain church-related matters (e.g. discipline of clergy, alteration of church property, and issues related to churchyards). Since the Reformation, ecclesiastical courts in England have been royal courts.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer fails to address how the lack of civil binding force specifically affects the practical authority and influence of the ecclesiastical courts. It only reiterates that they have jurisdiction over certain church-related matters and notes their royal court status, but does not explain the implications for enforcement, scope, or real-world power in the absence of civil binding force.

Validation failed for title: Post-punk.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What made The Roxy so important?', 'question': 'Given that The Roxy was mentioned as a significant venue for post-punk in the UK, what specific factors made The Roxy so important to that scene?', 'answer': 'The text does not provide details about The Roxy.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the Question. It claims there is no information about The Roxy, but the Question asks for concrete factors that made The Roxy important to the post-punk scene. The Answer should provide factual content (e.g., venue’s role as an early post-punk platform, notable acts, influence on club culture, booking practices, or its impact on the UK scene). As written, it fails to provide relevant or verifiable information.

Validation failed for title: Post-punk.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did The Roxy have a specific aesthetic?', 'question': 'Given its influence on post-punk, did The Roxy, like Madame Satã, cultivate a specific aesthetic beyond just the music it showcased?', 'answer': 'The text mentions that The Roxy helped create a new aesthetic that combined emotional intensity, political commentary, and sonic experimentation.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' should be a standalone restatement of the rag_input. The rag_input is 'Did The Roxy have a specific aesthetic?', but the 'Question' adds extra context ('influence on post-punk', 'like Madame Satã', 'beyond just the music') and references to Madame Satã not present in the rag_input, making it not a faithful standalone rephrasing.

Validation failed for title: Heresy.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any objections to his execution?', 'question': 'Following the execution of Cayetano Ripoll for heresy by the Catholic Church, were there any objections to this execution?', 'answer': 'His accusers were excommunicated both by Ambrose of Milan and Pope Siricius, who opposed Priscillian\'s heresy, but "believed capital punishment to be inappropriate at best and usually unequivocally evil".', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Answer' misnames the case and mixes details from Priscillian's trial; it discusses objections to Priscillian's execution, not Cayetano Ripoll, and attributes quotes to the wrong figures. Therefore it fails factual correctness relative to the given question.

Validation failed for title: Heresy.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about outside of Catholic countries?', 'question': "Besides the cases of heresy prosecutions in Catholic countries around the time of Cayetano Ripoll's execution in 1826, were there similar prosecutions for heresy in non-Catholic countries during that period?", 'answer': 'The document does not specify cases outside of Catholic countries.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer incorrectly claims there are no non-Catholic cases; the provided history includes a non-Catholic instance (England, 1612) of executing someone for heresy, which contradicts the claim and makes the answer factually inaccurate for the given question.

Validation failed for title: Hunter-gatherer.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Has their hostility always been consistent?', 'question': 'Given that the Sentinelese are known for their hostility toward outsiders, has this level of hostility remained consistent throughout their history?', 'answer': "The document doesn't provide specifics about variations in Sentinelese hostility over time, but it implies that it has been a long-standing characteristic.", 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer references a document (“The document doesn't provide specifics…”) which violates the requirement that the answer be self-contained and not mention external sources. A correct response should address the question without referring to any document, and provide a clear assessment based on the provided context.

Validation failed for title: Hunter-gatherer.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any instances of peaceful interaction?', 'question': 'Despite the consistent hostility displayed by the Sentinelese towards outsiders, have there been any documented instances of peaceful interaction or attempts at communication?', 'answer': 'The document mentions no documented instances of sustained or truly peaceful interaction. All attempts at contact have been met with resistance, even if the form of resistance evolved over time.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer references a document ('The document mentions...'), which violates the requirement to avoid mentioning sources in the Answer. The response should be self-contained and not refer to documents or retrievals.

Validation failed for title: Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What was the ancestry question?', 'question': 'Considering the discussion about the racial categories in the 1890 census, what was the ancestry question in earlier censuses?', 'answer': 'The 2010 census form did not contain the question titled "Ancestry" found in prior censuses.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question asks for the content of the ancestry question used in earlier censuses, but the Answer states that the 2010 census did not include the 'Ancestry' question. This does not answer the question about what the ancestry question was in earlier censuses and misaligns with the prompt's focus.

Validation failed for title: Asthma.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any specific preventative measures these workers can take?', 'question': 'Given that spray painters, bakers, food processors, nurses, chemical workers, animal handlers, welders, hairdressers, and timber workers are at high risk of developing asthma due to their jobs, are there any specific preventative measures these workers can take to reduce their risk?', 'answer': 'Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule 2 violated: The Question must be exactly identical to the rag_input for the first turn; here the Question adds context (enumerated worker types) and is not a direct copy of rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Asthma.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is there any evidence that early life exposures influence asthma development?', 'question': 'Considering the discussion about occupations with high asthma risk and preventative measures, is there any evidence that early life exposures influence the development of asthma?', 'answer': 'The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak. Some show promise including: limiting smoke exposure both in utero and after delivery, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication. Early pet exposure may be useful.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input. It adds contextual references to the discussion about occupations with high asthma risk and preventative measures, which violates the requirement that the Question be self-contained and not rely on prior turns. The rag_input is 'Is there any evidence that early life exposures influence asthma development?', and the corresponding Question should be a self-contained rephrase of that, not referencing prior dialogue.

Validation failed for title: Asthma.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What is the role of genetics?', 'question': 'Considering that early life exposures influence asthma development, what is the role of genetics in asthma?', 'answer': 'Family history is a risk factor for asthma, with many different genes being implicated. If one identical twin is affected, the probability of the other having the disease is approximately 25%.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input does not clearly build on the prior turn and is not contextually connected to the previous discussion. It asks only 'What is the role of genetics?' without tying to earlier asthma-related context. The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input; it introduces an external context about early life exposures and asthma, making it not self-contained or identical in meaning to the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Asthma.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about asthma treatment?', 'question': 'Given the discussion about genetic and environmental factors, what about asthma treatment?', 'answer': 'There is no cure for asthma. Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled. Treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth. In very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The response violates the validation rules in two ways: (1) The Question is not standalone; it references prior discussion ('Given the discussion about genetic and environmental factors'), so it cannot be understood without history. (2) The Type field is missing; it must be one of Follow-up, Clarification, Correction, or Comparative and align with the content. These issues mean the JSON does not meet the required format and content criteria.

Validation failed for title: Digestion.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about the enzymes involved in that process?', 'question': 'Following the formation and processing of chyme, what are some of the enzymes involved in the digestion process as it moves through the small intestine?', 'answer': 'The chyme mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver in the duodenum. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. Examples of digestive enzymes would be pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas, which break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer incorrectly cites pepsin as an enzyme active in the small intestine (pepsin is a gastric enzyme; it functions in the stomach and is inactivated in the small intestine). In the small intestine, digestion relies on pancreatic enzymes (e.g., trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidases, pancreatic amylase, pancreatic lipase) and brush-border enzymes (e.g., lactase, sucrase, maltase, aminopeptidases, dipeptidases). Bile is not an enzyme but aids fat emulsification. Therefore the answer is not fully correct.

Validation failed for title: Digestion.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Where does enterokinase come from?', 'question': 'Given that enterokinase is responsible for initiating the activation cascade of pancreatic zymogens in the duodenum, what is the origin or source of the enterokinase enzyme itself?', 'answer': 'Trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen, which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer explains how trypsinogen is activated by enterokinase, but it does not state where enterokinase itself comes from. The origin of enterokinase is the duodenal mucosa (brush-border enteropeptidase) produced by intestinal cells; the provided answer does not address that and is incomplete/wrong for the asked question.

Validation failed for title: Glacier.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are the implications of basal instability for glacial erosion?', 'question': 'Given the discussion about cold-based and warm-based glaciers and their susceptibility to surges, what are the implications of basal instability, which is more common in warm-based glaciers, for the process of glacial erosion?', 'answer': 'Warm-based glaciers are able to slide at their base, promoting plucking at rock from the surface below, thus leading to more erosion.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone: it references prior discussion about cold-based and warm-based glaciers and surges, which makes it depend on history rather than being a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input. It also introduces an assertion about basal instability being more common in warm-based glaciers that is not present in the rag_input. The rag_input is a general prompt; the Question should rephrase it without relying on earlier turns.

Validation failed for title: Dutch_Republic.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were these attempts largely successful?', 'question': 'Given the various attempts to change the power dynamic between the Generality Lands and the provinces, were these attempts largely successful?', 'answer': 'The document does not provide enough information to determine the overall success of these attempts. It mentions specific reforms and movements but does not offer a comprehensive assessment of their success.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The declared Type is 'Clarification' but the content functions as a follow-up question that builds on the prior answer. It should be 'Follow-up' to align with the intended role (continuing the discussion).

Validation failed for title: Royal_Dutch_Shell.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "You mentioned shifting energy strategy; can you elaborate on Shell's move towards gas and renewables around that time?", 'question': "Given Shell's 2013 pause in Arctic drilling due to environmental and economic factors, including low oil prices and a shifting energy strategy, can you elaborate on Shell's move towards gas and renewable energy sources around that time?", 'answer': "In February 2010 Shell and Cosan formed a 50:50 joint-venture, Raízen, comprising all of Cosan's Brazilian ethanol, energy generation, fuel distribution and sugar activities, and all of Shell's Brazilian retail fuel and aviation distribution businesses. In March 2010, Shell announced the sale of some of its assets, including its liquid petroleum gas (LPG) business, to meet the cost of a planned $28bn capital spending programme.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The rag_input and question are coherent as a follow-up about Shell's move toward gas and renewables, but the provided Answer does not address that topic. It discusses a 2010 Raízen joint venture and LPG asset sales, which are unrelated to Shell's gas/renewables strategy around that time.

Validation failed for title: Immunology.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there other ways the immune system can fail?', 'question': 'Besides HIV causing AIDS, are there other ways the immune system can fail, leading to immune deficiency?', 'answer': 'Yes, other ways the immune system can fail include genetic defects, malnutrition, certain medications, and other infections.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references 'Besides HIV causing AIDS', which relies on prior discussion. A compliant standalone rephrase should not assume history and should mirror the RAG_input's generic prompt about other immune-failure mechanisms (e.g., 'What are other ways the immune system can fail?'). The Type is appropriate (Follow-up), and the Answer itself is factually reasonable, but the standalone-question requirement is not met.

Validation failed for title: Literature.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were any of these works initially transmitted orally?', 'question': 'Regarding the ancient Chinese literature examples you provided, such as The Classics of Confucianism, the Daoist Texts, The Art of War, and the Records of the Grand Historian, were any of these works initially transmitted orally before being written down?', 'answer': 'No ancient Chinese literature mentioned in the document was initially transmitted orally.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer incorrectly asserts that none of the listed works were transmitted orally and refers to a 'document'; it should not mention a document. Additionally, historically, many ancient Chinese texts originated in oral traditions, so the negative claim is likely inaccurate or oversimplified.

Validation failed for title: Literature.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did oral tradition influence the style of these works?', 'question': 'Given that many ancient Chinese literary works, like the Shijing and the Analects, were initially transmitted orally, did this oral tradition influence the style or characteristics of these works when they were eventually written down?', 'answer': 'The document states that spoken word allowed for flexibility in tone, rhythm, and interpretation—qualities that were often lost in rigid written forms.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer incorrectly asserts no Chinese works were transmitted orally and references a document, which violates the rule not to mention any document. It also fails to answer the rag_input accurately, as it should indicate whether any of the mentioned Chinese works were shared orally before being written. Additionally, it erroneously introduces India when the question concerns Chinese literature.

Validation failed for title: Literature.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there examples of written texts later influencing oral traditions?', 'question': 'Considering how oral traditions influenced the written forms of ancient Chinese texts, like the Shijing and Analects, are there also examples of written texts later influencing the development or adaptation of oral traditions in China?', 'answer': 'The document does not provide information about written texts influencing oral traditions.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Answer' references 'the document,' which violates the rule not to mention that a document was provided. The response should be self-contained and not rely on or reference external documents. Additionally, the answer may be incomplete or inaccurate if it asserts there are no examples without verification.

Validation failed for title: Literature.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were dramas affected by this two-way influence?', 'question': 'Given that both oral traditions shaped written texts and written texts reshaped spoken forms in ancient China, as we discussed, were dramatic works, as a form of literature intended for performance, also significantly affected by this two-way influence between spoken and written forms?', 'answer': 'The document mentions that drama is literature intended for performance, often combined with music and dance.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer does not address whether dramas were affected by the two-way influence; it only restates a general property of drama (that it is literature for performance) and does not discuss how oral-to-written and written-to-oral exchanges would impact dramatic works.

Validation failed for title: Architecture.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did any particular philosophies become more dominant as a result?', 'question': 'Considering the tensions created within the architectural profession due to the Industrial Revolution, did any particular design or architectural philosophies become more dominant as a result of these tensions?', 'answer': 'Among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach to building design are rationalism, empiricism, structuralism, poststructuralism, and phenomenology.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer lists several philosophies but does not specify which became more dominant due to the tensions from the Industrial Revolution, nor does it clearly tie those dominances to that context. It speaks to influence in general rather than directly addressing dominance or the cause-effect implied by the question.

Validation failed for title: Architecture.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So what were the primary critiques of these approaches?', 'question': 'Given the influence of rationalism and empiricism on architecture after the Industrial Revolution, what were the primary critiques or criticisms leveled against these architectural approaches?', 'answer': 'Many architects resisted modernism, finding it devoid of the decorative richness of historical styles. As the first generation of modernists began to die after WWII, a second generation of architects including Paul Rudolph, Marcel Breuer, and Eero Saarinen tried to expand the aesthetics of modernism with Brutalism, buildings with expressive sculptural facades made of unfinished concrete. But an even new younger postwar generation critiqued modernism and Brutalism for being too austere, standardized, monotone, and not taking into account the richness of human experience offered in historical buildings across time and in different places and cultures.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The rag_input asks for the primary criticisms of rationalism and empiricism in architecture after the Industrial Revolution. The provided answer discusses critiques of modernism and Brutalism (a later development) as being too austere and lacking human experience, rather than addressing criticisms aimed at rationalist and empiricist approaches themselves. It does not explicitly tie criticisms to rationalism/empiricism or cover expected points like ornament vs. function, human-centered concerns, or the tension between rational systems and experiential quality.

Validation failed for title: Tristan_da_Cunha.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Why did the UK annex the islands not long after?', 'question': "Following Jonathan Lambert's settlement of Tristan da Cunha, you mentioned that the United Kingdom annexed the islands shortly after; what was the reason for this annexation?", 'answer': 'In 1816, the United Kingdom annexed the islands, ruling them from the Cape Colony in South Africa. This is reported to have primarily been a measure to ensure that the French would be unable to use the islands as a base for a rescue operation to free Napoleon Bonaparte from his prison on Saint Helena. The occupation also prevented the United States from using Tristan da Cunha as a cruiser base, as it had during the War of 1812.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not fully standalone; it relies on referencing a prior statement with 'you mentioned'. A standalone rephrasing should be self-contained and not refer to the prior turn. The RAG_input is clear and contextually connected, the Type is appropriate (Follow-up), and the provided Answer is factually correct. The only failing aspect is the requirement that the Question be self-contained without referencing previous turns.

Validation failed for title: Warsaw_Pact.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Given that the threat was perceived as political and ideological, what specific strategies did the West employ to counter the Warsaw Pact's influence beyond military deterrence?", 'question': "Considering that the West viewed the threat posed by the Warsaw Pact as primarily political and ideological rather than a direct military aggression, what specific non-military strategies did NATO and its allies implement to counter the Warsaw Pact's influence?", 'answer': 'For 36 years, NATO and the Warsaw Pact never directly waged war against each other in Europe; the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies implemented strategic policies aimed at the containment of each other in Europe, while working and fighting for influence within the wider Cold War on the international stage.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not meet the requirement for specificity. It states a general containment dynamic but fails to enumerate or describe concrete non-military strategies (diplomacy, economic measures, sanctions, political pressure, alliance-building, propaganda/information campaigns, cultural diplomacy, arms control, etc.) that NATO and allies used against Warsaw Pact influence. Therefore it's not a precise, standalone answer to the question.

Validation failed for title: Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What specific Nintendo policies impacted the game library?', 'question': "Considering that the SNES's superior game library was a key factor in its success, what specific policies implemented by Nintendo influenced or contributed to the quality and content of its game library?", 'answer': 'Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer is not fully correct. It states that Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles for the system, which is an oversimplification and not accurate for the SNES era. While Nintendo did govern licensing and had policies shaping the library, the SNES era still involved third-party publishers and a more open licensing environment compared to the NES. Key policies included licensing terms for third-party developers, publication limits, and regional considerations—not a blanket 'exclusive control' of all titles.

Validation failed for title: Iranian_languages.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which languages are the largest?', 'question': 'Based on the estimated number of native speakers in 2008, which Iranian languages are considered the largest?', 'answer': 'The largest amongst them being Persian, Pashto, Kurdish, and Balochi.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a stand-alone rephrasing of the RAG_input. The RAG_input asks generally 'Which languages are the largest?' without specifying Iranian languages or a date. The Question adds 'Iranian languages' and 'based on the estimated number of native speakers in 2008', introducing new context not present in the RAG_input. This fails requirement 2 (standalone rephrasing).

Validation failed for title: Iranian_languages.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Why the discrepancy between the first answer and this list?', 'question': 'Considering the previous statement that Persian, Pashto, Kurdish, and Balochi are the largest Iranian languages, why does the more recent list provided focus primarily on Persian, Tajik, and Azerbaijani, and include Kurmanji with caveats?', 'answer': "The previous answer from the document lists the languages mentioned: Persian, Pashto, Kurdish, and Balochi. The second answer that the model provided appears to be hallucinated, mixing true and untrue information, and including a Turkic language, while at the same time stating it isn't necessarily included, as well as removing Pashto and Balochi.", 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. It introduces new details (references to specific languages like Tajik, Azerbaijani, Kurmanji) and context not present in the RAG_input, and it mentions a 'previous statement' rather than restating the RAG_input itself. This violates the requirement that the Question be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Iranian_languages.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are the historical stages of these languages?', 'question': 'Considering the clarification regarding Iranian languages and their speakers, what are the different historical stages through which these languages have evolved?', 'answer': 'Old Iranian (until 400 BCE), Middle Iranian (400 BCE – 900 CE), and New Iranian (since 900 CE).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. It relies on a prior clarification and uses 'these languages' without explicit context, making it not self-contained. A correct version would restate the RAG_input in a self-contained way, such as: 'What are the three historical stages of Iranian languages (Old Iranian, Middle Iranian, and New Iranian)?'

Validation failed for title: Iranian_languages.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'I meant for languages.', 'question': 'Considering our previous discussion about the historical stages of Iranian languages, and given that the last response discussed insect development, I meant what are the names of the historical stages for languages, specifically Iranian languages?', 'answer': 'Old Iranian, Middle Iranian, and New Iranian.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input. The rag_input is 'I meant for languages.' which lacks any context about Iranian languages or historical stages. The Question adds references to previous discussion and insect development, making it non-self-contained and not a faithful restatement of the rag_input. This violates the standalone rephrasing requirement.

Validation failed for title: Great_Plains.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned systemic racism affecting African American settlers. Can you elaborate on specific laws or policies that hindered their success?', 'question': 'Given the challenges faced by African American settlers on the Great Plains, what specific discriminatory laws, policies, or practices, beyond general systemic racism, directly undermined their ability to establish successful farms and communities?', 'answer': 'They were frequently excluded from Grange meetings, church leadership, and other community organizations that provided social and economic support.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer addresses social exclusion from organizations, which is a social practice rather than a specific discriminatory law or policy. The prompt asked for concrete laws, policies, or practices that directly hindered African American settlers’ ability to establish farms and communities; the response does not meet that scope.

Validation failed for title: Sony_Music_Entertainment.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What was the immediate effect on album releases?', 'question': "After Sony acquired Bertelsmann's stake in Sony BMG on October 1, 2008 and the company reverted to Sony Music Entertainment (SME), what was the immediate effect on album releases?", 'answer': "The last few albums to feature a Sony BMG logo were Thriller 25 by Michael Jackson, I Am... Sasha Fierce by Beyoncé, Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits by Christina Aguilera, and Safe Trip Home by Dido.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule 2 violation: The 'Question' must be an exact, standalone rephrasing of the 'rag_input' (identical for the first turn). However, the provided 'Question' adds extra context and is not identical to 'What was the immediate effect on album releases?'. Additionally, the 'Question' should be self-contained without referencing prior history beyond what's in the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Sony_Music_Entertainment.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Was Doug Morris's arrival related to any of that?", 'question': "Was Doug Morris's arrival as chairman and CEO of Sony Music Entertainment on July 1, 2011, related to any internal restructuring that might have occurred after the acquisition and rebranding?", 'answer': "Doug Morris' arrival was followed by a restructuring. He was joined by L.A. Reid, who became the chairman and CEO of Epic Records. Under Reid, multiple artists from the Jive half of the former RCA/Jive Label Group moved to Epic. Peter Edge became the new CEO of the RCA Records unit. The RCA Music Group closed down Arista, J Records and Jive Records in October 2011, with the artists from those labels being moved to RCA Records.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not identical to the rag_input; the rule requires the Question to be exactly the same as the rag_input in the first turn. rag_input: 'Was Doug Morris's arrival related to any of that?' vs. Question: 'Was Doug Morris's arrival as chairman and CEO of Sony Music Entertainment on July 1, 2011, related to any internal restructuring that might have occurred after the acquisition and rebranding?'. The added details make it a different prompt.

Validation failed for title: Aspirated_consonant.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How many degrees of aspiration are typically marked in IPA?', 'question': 'You mentioned languages with contrastive aspirated fricatives. Now, how many degrees of aspiration are typically marked in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)?', 'answer': 'Typically only two degrees are marked: unaspirated ⟨k⟩ and aspirated ⟨kʰ⟩.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Mismatch: in the first-turn format, 'Question' must be identical to 'rag_input'. Here rag_input is 'How many degrees of aspiration are typically marked in IPA?' but the 'Question' adds extra wording about prior discussion, so they are not identical.

Validation failed for title: Aspirated_consonant.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are voiced consonants ever truly aspirated?', 'question': 'Given our discussion of aspiration and preaspiration, are voiced consonants ever truly aspirated, or is the term used differently in those cases?', 'answer': "True aspirated voiced consonants, as opposed to murmured (breathy-voice) consonants such as the [bʱ], [dʱ], [ɡʱ] that are common in the languages of India, are extremely rare. They have been documented in Kelabit Taa, and the Kx'a languages.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the 'rag_input'. It references 'our discussion' (history) and thus relies on prior turns. It should be a self-contained restatement of the RAG_input without referencing past conversation.

Validation failed for title: Mali.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What impact did this have on trade?', 'question': 'Following the Moroccan invasion that led to the collapse of the Songhai Empire, what was the impact on trade in the region?', 'answer': "The fall of the Songhai Empire marked the end of the region's role as a trading crossroads. Following the establishment of sea routes by the European powers, the trans-Saharan trade routes lost significance.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule 2 violated: The 'Question' must be a standalone rephrasing of the 'rag_input' and not identical. In this input, 'Question' is exactly the same as 'rag_input', failing to provide a self-contained rephrasing.

Validation failed for title: Mali.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who was Mansa Musa?', 'question': 'Given that Mansa Musa was mentioned as a sponsor of scholars and astronomers during the Mali Empire, can you provide a more detailed description of who Mansa Musa was and what his role was within the Mali Empire?', 'answer': 'Scholars like Mansa Musa, the empire’s most famous ruler, sponsored scholars and astronomers. Mansa Musa’s pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324 brought African knowledge and culture to the Islamic world and highlighted Mali’s wealth and sophistication.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Question is identical to rag_input (it should be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input, not the exact same wording). Additionally, the Type field is missing and should be one of: Follow-up, Clarification, Correction, Comparative.

Validation failed for title: Mali.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What were the main exports of the Mali Empire besides gold?', 'question': "Considering the Mali Empire's control of trans-Saharan trade routes and Mansa Musa's wealth derived from that trade, what were the primary goods, aside from gold, that the empire exported?", 'answer': 'At its peak, the Mali Empire controlled vital trans-Saharan trade routes that connected sub-Saharan Africa with the Mediterranean world. This allowed the empire to thrive economically through the trade of: - Gold (from the gold fields of present-day Mali and neighboring regions) - Salt (from the salt mines of the Sahara, especially in present-day Niger) - Slaves, ivory, and other goods', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer incorrectly includes gold as an export, but the rag_input asks for exports aside from gold; it should list salt, slaves, ivory, and other goods instead of repeating gold.

Validation failed for title: Infrared.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Besides high altitude, what other adaptations are made to deal with atmospheric water vapor?', 'question': 'The response detailed uses of infrared radiation and how water vapor affects infrared telescopes, including placing telescopes at high altitudes to mitigate water vapor interference. What other adaptations are made to deal with atmospheric water vapor besides placing telescopes at high altitude?', 'answer': 'Telescopes can be carried aloft with a balloon or an aircraft. Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap, and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references the previous answer and describes prior content. It should be a self-contained rephrasing of the rag_input without referring to prior turns or documents.

Validation failed for title: Infrared.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there limitations to infrared cleaning?', 'question': 'Are there situations where infrared cleaning is not effective or has limitations when used in film scanning?', 'answer': 'I am sorry, I do not have the information to answer this question.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer is not the correct ground-truth: it merely apologizes and provides no factual information. The rule requires a factually correct answer detailing limitations of infrared cleaning, such as potential loss of fine texture, misinterpretation of IR data on certain film stocks, dependence on precise IR-channel alignment, risk of over-smoothing or inpainting artifacts, and circumstances where IR cleaning may fail (e.g., very subtle defects, uniform dark areas, or certain materials).

Validation failed for title: Sanskrit.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What was the script that came between them?', 'question': 'What script evolved after the Śāradā script but before the Devanagari script displaced it?', 'answer': 'The Siddhaṃ script was an intermediary stage between the Śāradā and Devanagari scripts.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Requirement failed: The 'Question' must be exactly identical to the 'rag_input' for the first turn. Here rag_input is 'What was the script that came between them?', but Question is 'What script evolved after the Śāradā script but before the Devanagari script displaced it?', so it is not an exact restatement.

Validation failed for title: Baptists.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What similarities did the General Baptists share with the Dutch Waterlander Mennonites?', 'question': 'Given the discussion about Anabaptist influence on Baptists, what similarities did the General Baptists share with the Dutch Waterlander Mennonites?', 'answer': "The General Baptists shared similarities with Dutch Waterlander Mennonites including believer's baptism only, religious liberty, separation of church and state, and Arminian views of salvation, predestination and original sin.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Question must be identical to rag_input (the first-turn prompt). In this entry, the Question adds a preface 'Given the discussion about Anabaptist influence on Baptists,' which means it is not identical to the rag_input and thus violates the required exactly-match rule.

Validation failed for title: Geography_of_the_United_States.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which countries are larger than the US in total area?', 'question': 'Which countries are larger than the United States in total area?', 'answer': 'China, Russia, and Canada are larger than the United States in total area.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer lists China, Russia, and Canada as larger than the US by total area, but China is not definitively larger than the US in total area; standard figures typically show Russia and Canada larger, with China around or slightly smaller than the US depending on measurement. Therefore the answer is not factually correct for a clear, unambiguous interpretation.

Validation failed for title: Wayback_Machine.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are you sure? You said it was announced in October 2013.', 'question': "Are you sure that you don't have information about the 'Save a Page' feature when you previously stated it was announced in October 2013?", 'answer': 'Yes, the "Save a Page" feature was announced in October 2013, and it became a threat of abuse by the service for hosting malicious binaries.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: Rule 2 violation: The 'Question' is not a faithful standalone rephrase of the rag_input; it adds content about the 'Save a Page' feature and about information absence, making it non-self-contained relative to the original rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Wayback_Machine.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there other potential legal issues with the Wayback Machine?', 'question': "Besides the risk of the 'Save a Page' feature being abused to host malicious binaries, were there other potential legal issues associated with the Wayback Machine?", 'answer': "Yes, the Wayback Machine faced several legal issues, including copyright concerns, DMCA violations, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act accusations, and lawsuits related to archiving web sites against the owners' wishes.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrase of the rag_input. It references the risk context of the 'Save a Page' feature, which is not present in the rag_input, violating the requirement that the Question be self-contained and clearly derived from the rag_input without external context. It should simply ask about other potential legal issues with the Wayback Machine.

Validation failed for title: Symbiosis.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are both types always beneficial to at least one organism?', 'question': 'In both ectosymbiosis and endosymbiosis, is the relationship always beneficial to at least one of the organisms involved?', 'answer': 'Yes, in both ectosymbiosis and endosymbiosis, at least one organism benefits. The relationship could be mutualistic (both benefit), commensalistic (one benefits, the other is unaffected), or parasitic (one benefits, the other is harmed).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer asserts that at least one organism always benefits in ectosymbiosis and endosymbiosis. This overlooks synnecrosis, a rare interaction where both organisms are harmed, so the relationship is not always beneficial to at least one.

Validation failed for title: Symbiosis.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can a symbiotic relationship change types over time?', 'question': 'Given that symbiotic relationships are defined by the interaction between organisms, is it possible for a specific symbiotic relationship to transition between being mutualistic, commensal, or parasitic over a period of time?', 'answer': 'The document does not explicitly state whether a symbiotic relationship can change types over time. However, given that environmental conditions and the needs of the organisms involved can change, it is plausible that a relationship could shift between mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The rag_input, Question, and Type are valid and follow-up in nature. However, the Answer relies on or references an external 'document' and hedges the conclusion instead of directly stating that such a transition is possible. The requirement is for a self-contained, directly correct answer to the standalone question (i.e., yes, a symbiotic relationship can change types over time, with brief justification). The provided Answer does not meet that criterion due to the document reference and hedged phrasing.

Validation failed for title: Animal.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any organisms besides plants and animals that have unique intercellular structures?', 'question': 'Besides plants and animals, are there any other types of organisms that have intercellular structures that are unique to them?', 'answer': 'The document does not provide information on intercellular structures in organisms other than animals (tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes) and plants (cell walls and plasmodesmata). It mentions fungi having cell walls.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide a direct, standalone answer to the question. It references 'the document' rather than giving a self-contained factual statement, and it does not clearly state whether organisms other than plants and animals have any unique intercellular structures. It also mixes meta-information with content instead of delivering a concise conclusion.

Validation failed for title: Animal.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are these hyphal junctions found in all fungi?', 'question': 'Are hyphal junctions, which facilitate communication and transport between fungal cells, present in all types of fungi, or are they specific to certain groups such as ascomycetes and basidiomycetes?', 'answer': 'The document does not specify if hyphal junctions are found in all fungi.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide a standalone, factual clarification about whether hyphal junctions occur in all fungi. It merely states that a document does not specify, which leaves the user with an unresolved clarification instead of a direct, self-contained answer. It also implicitly references a document, which is not appropriate for a self-contained clarification.

Validation failed for title: Animal.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How do Zygomycota communicate without septal junctions?', 'question': 'Given that Zygomycota, which are a type of fungi, lack septal junctions for cell-to-cell communication as found in other fungi like Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, what alternative mechanisms do Zygomycota use to facilitate communication between their cells?', 'answer': 'Zygomycota communicate via diffusion or cytoplasmic bridges.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer claims 'diffusion or cytoplasmic bridges' for Zygomycota. Zygomycota have aseptate (coenocytic) hyphae, so there are no septa or distinct adjacent cells to bridge. Communication occurs mainly via diffusion within the continuous cytoplasm; the concept of 'cytoplasmic bridges' between cells is not applicable. The correct answer should emphasize diffusion within the continuous cytoplasm as the primary mechanism and not mention intercellular bridges between cells.

Validation failed for title: Political_party.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is there a difference between a whip in the majority party versus the minority party?', 'question': 'Considering the role of a party whip in ensuring party discipline and coordinating legislative strategy, is there a significant difference in the function or power of a whip in the majority party compared to one in the minority party?', 'answer': 'When a party is not in power (e.g., the opposition), the minority leader acts as the chief spokesperson for the party in the legislature. Their responsibilities include defending minority rights, criticizing the majority party’s policies, and organizing opposition strategies.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer discusses the minority leader rather than the party whip, and does not address the question about differences in the function or power of the whip between the majority and minority parties. This makes the response not directly relevant to the rag_input/Question.

Validation failed for title: Nutrition.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about specific combinations of these foods?', 'question': 'Given the beneficial foods for gut flora, are there specific combinations of these foods that are particularly synergistic or advantageous for promoting gut health?', 'answer': 'It is possible with protein combinations of two incomplete protein sources (e.g., rice and beans) to make a complete protein source, and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions. However, complementary sources of protein do not need to be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body. Excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis. The amino acids remaining after such conversion are discarded.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer addresses protein-combination for complete proteins and gluconeogenesis instead of identifying specific foods or combinations that synergistically promote gut microbiota health. The user’s question asks for combinations with broad, synergistic gut health effects (fiber, polyphenols, resistant starch, fermented foods, etc.). The provided answer is not aligned with the RAG_input’s intent.

Validation failed for title: Nutrition.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any combinations that might be detrimental?', 'question': 'Given the beneficial food combinations for gut health, are there any specific food combinations that could be detrimental to the gut microbiota and overall gut health?', 'answer': 'Nonetheless, processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole, fresh foods, regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches, potassium/sodium, vitamins, fiber, and of intact, unoxidized (essential) fatty acids. In addition, processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not fully standalone; it references 'beneficial food combinations' from prior turns, which violates the requirement that the question be self-contained and understandable without history. Additionally, the 'Answer' does not explicitly enumerate specific detrimental food combinations, but only discusses processed foods in general, which may not fully address the asked prompt.

Validation failed for title: Melbourne.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about those targets for carbon neutrality; are they on track?', 'question': "Considering Melbourne's environmental sustainability initiatives and carbon neutrality targets, is the city currently on track to meet those carbon neutrality goals?", 'answer': 'In response to attribution of recent climate change, the City of Melbourne, in 2002, set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2020 and Moreland City Council established the Zero Moreland program, however not all metropolitan municipalities have followed, with the City of Glen Eira notably deciding in 2009 not to become carbon neutral.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer does not address whether Melbourne is on track to meet carbon neutrality goals. It mentions historical targets (net zero by 2020) and a council example but provides no current progress, metrics, or status. Additionally, the factual claim about Melbourne setting a net-zero target by 2020 may be inaccurate or not universally recognized, making the response unreliable.

Validation failed for title: Melbourne.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What kind of progress have they made on public transport?', 'question': "Given Melbourne's revised climate action plan aiming for net zero emissions by 2030, and its focus on reducing reliance on fossil fuel-based transport, what specific progress has the city made in improving and expanding its public transport system?", 'answer': "Melbourne has an integrated public transport system based around extensive train, tram, bus and taxi systems. Flinders Street Station was the world's busiest passenger station in 1927 and Melbourne's tram network overtook Sydney's to become the world's largest in the 1940s, at which time 25% of travellers used public transport but by 2003 it had declined to just 7.6%. The public transport system was privatised in 1999, symbolising the peak of the decline. Despite privatisation and successive governments persisting with auto-centric urban development into the 21st century, there have since been large increases in public transport patronage, with the mode share for commuters increasing to 14.8% and 8.4% of all trips. A target of 20% public transport mode share for Melbourne by 2020 was set by the state government in 2006. Since 2006 public transport patronage has grown by over 20%.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer discusses broad historical trends and older targets but does not clearly tie progress to the revised 2030 net-zero plan or provide current, plan-specific metrics. It lacks up-to-date indicators of progress (e.g., recent investments, service improvements, electrification, and measurable progress toward the 2030 target) directly connected to Melbourne's public transport improvements.

Validation failed for title: East_India_Company.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Did this event impact the East India Company's operations beyond the immediate closures?", 'question': "Considering the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's response to the piracy of the Ganj-i-Sawai, including the closure of factories, did this event have any longer-term or wider impacts on the East India Company's operations?", 'answer': "The plunder of Aurangzeb's treasure ship had serious consequences for the English East India Company. To appease Emperor Aurangzeb and particularly his Grand Vizier Asad Khan, Parliament exempted Every from all of the Acts of Grace (pardons) and amnesties it would subsequently issue to other pirates.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided Answer does not address the Question about longer-term or wider impacts on the East India Company's operations. It cites a narrow policy action (parliamentary exemption from Acts of Grace for Henry Every) rather than discussing broader operational, financial, or governance consequences for the EIC that would constitute a longer-term impact.

Validation failed for title: East_India_Company.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did the East India Company ever engage in naval battles themselves?', 'question': "Beyond the response to Every's piracy, did the East India Company ever engage in naval battles directly?", 'answer': "At the Battle of Pulo Aura, which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, Nathaniel Dance, Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the Warley, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references a prior response ('Beyond the response to Every's piracy'), tying it to earlier turns. Standalone questions must be self-contained and understandable without history.

Validation failed for title: List_of_numbered_streets_in_Manhattan.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, 228th Street isn't part of that original plan?", 'question': "Is 228th Street, the highest numbered street in Manhattan, part of the Commissioner's Plan of 1811?", 'answer': "The document does not explicitly state whether 228th Street was part of the original Commissioner's Plan of 1811.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input's Answer references 'the document', which violates the rule of never mentioning that a document was provided.

Validation failed for title: List_of_numbered_streets_in_Manhattan.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any other streets with viaducts?', 'question': 'Besides 155th Street, which has a notable viaduct, are there any other numbered streets in Manhattan that also feature viaducts?', 'answer': 'The document only mentions the viaduct on 155th Street.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document,' which violates the rule that the response must not mention a document or its provenance. The Answer should be a standalone factual statement without referencing sources.

Validation failed for title: The_Times.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What were the readership numbers immediately before the switch?', 'question': 'Given that there is no direct information about the impact of the tabloid switch on readership, what were the readership numbers of The Times immediately before it switched to tabloid format in 2004?', 'answer': "At the time of Harold Evans' appointment as editor in 1981, The Times had an average daily sale of 282,000 copies in comparison to the 1.4 million daily sales of its traditional rival The Daily Telegraph.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided Answer cites readership numbers from 1981 (The Times 282,000) rather than the figures immediately before the 2004 tabloid switch. The RAG_input question requires pre-2004 readership data, so the answer does not satisfy the query.

Validation failed for title: Eritrea.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned tsebhi dorho. What exactly is that, and what makes it unique?', 'question': 'Following a discussion about Italian-influenced dishes in Eritrea and Eritrean twists on these dishes, like serving lasagna with tsebhi dorho, can you describe what tsebhi dorho is and what makes it unique?', 'answer': 'Tsebhi dorho is a tomato-based stew that employs more tomatoes.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer is not factually accurate or sufficiently complete. Tsebhi dorho is typically a chicken-based (dorho) tomato-based stew flavored with Eritrean spices (e.g., berbere). Describing it as simply "a tomato-based stew that employs more tomatoes" is vague and incorrect regarding the main ingredient and the dish's distinctive flavor profile.

Validation failed for title: Eritrea.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Does the type of injera served with tsebhi dorho vary?', 'question': 'Given our discussion about Eritrean cuisine, specifically tsebhi dorho, does the type of injera served with it vary?', 'answer': 'N/A', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it references 'our discussion' about Eritrean cuisine, which relies on conversation history and violates the requirement that the Question be self-contained. Additionally, the 'Answer' is 'N/A' and does not provide a factual answer to the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Eritrea.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there other common stews besides tsebhi dorho?', 'question': 'Given that tsebhi dorho is a common Eritrean stew often served with injera, what are some other common stews in Eritrean cuisine?', 'answer': 'A typical traditional Eritrean dish consists of injera accompanied by a spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, kid, lamb or fish.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the rag_input question. It provides a generic statement about Eritrean meals rather than listing or identifying other common Eritrean stews as requested.
