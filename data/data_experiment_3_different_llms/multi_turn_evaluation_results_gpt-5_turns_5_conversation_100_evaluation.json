Earlier variants and philosophical mentions include George Berkeley talking about \u201can invisible elephant in the room\u201d and logician Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s example of a rhinoceros in the room to show the impossibility of proving negative existential statements.\n\n5. 1814: Ivan Andreevich Krylov wrote a fable \u201cThe Inquisitive Man\u201d about a man noticing tiny things but failing to notice an elephant in a museum; this became proverbial and was referenced by Fyodor Dostoevsky.\n\nThese earlier usages and variants illustrate the notion of a large, obvious presence that is overlooked or ignored, which underpins the modern idiom \u201celephant in the room.\u201d",

The problem is an obvious and significant one but is deliberately ignored or avoided in conversation.\n\nThe phrase \"pink elephant in the room,\" especially in reference to alcohol abuse, is a variation of this idiom. It is sometimes coupled with the \"elephant in the room\" idiom and implies hallucinations or delusions commonly associated with severe alcohol intoxication or withdrawal, as \"seeing pink elephants\" is a euphemism for such phenomena. Thus, \"pink elephant in the room\" metaphorically highlights an obvious issue related to alcohol abuse that is being ignored.",

Obviousness Yet Avoidance: \n   - All three acknowledge that there is an evident reality or issue present.\n   - This issue is generally avoided, unspoken, or ignored by those involved.\n2. Social or Philosophical Significance: \n   - Each concept highlights the tension between what is known and what is openly acknowledged or discussed.\n3. Taboo or Difficult Subjects: \n   - They commonly involve topics that are embarrassing, controversial, or socially uncomfortable to address directly.\n\nDifferences:\n1. Nature of the Concept:\n   - \"Elephant in the room\" is a metaphorical idiom widely used in English to denote an obvious problem or risk that people deliberately avoid discussing.\n   - \"Mokita,\" from the Kilivila language of Papua New Guinea, literally means \"the truth we all know but agree not to talk about,\" emphasizing a social agreement or tacit censorship within a community.\n   - Wittgenstein\u2019s \"rhinoceros in the room\" is a philosophical example illustrating logical problems, specifically the impossibility of proving negative existential statements (e.g., proving that something does not exist).\n2. Context and Use:\n   - The \"elephant in the room\" is primarily used in everyday language and social situations to highlight avoidance of pressing issues.\n   - \"Mokita\" represents a cultural linguistic concept reflecting communal silence on known truths.\n   - Wittgenstein\u2019s rhinoceros serves as a philosophical tool in logic and epistemology rather than a social metaphor.\n3. Emphasis:\n   - The \"elephant in the room\" emphasizes the conspicuousness of the ignored issue and the social dynamics preventing its discussion.\n   - \"Mokita\" emphasizes the collective acknowledgment paired with intentional silence.\n   - Wittgenstein\u2019s rhinoceros emphasizes epistemological limits\u2014specifically, difficulties in proving non-existence.\n\nIn summary, while all three revolve around unspoken but known realities, \"elephant in the room\" and \"mokita\" focus more on social dynamics of silence and avoidance, with \"mokita\" highlighting a communal pact of silence, and Wittgenstein\u2019s \"rhinoceros in the room\" is a philosophical illustration concerning the limits of knowledge and proof rather than a social metaphor.",

Primary Activities:\n   - G1 phase: The cell grows in size, carries out normal metabolic functions, and synthesizes proteins and organelles. It increases its supply of proteins, increases the number of organelles (such as mitochondria and ribosomes), and expands cytoplasm. The cell prepares for DNA replication but has not yet duplicated its DNA.  \n   - G2 phase: The cell continues to grow and produce proteins, particularly those needed for mitosis. It prepares for cell division by synthesizing proteins and rapidly growing. The mitochondria divide (and in plants, chloroplasts also divide). Microtubules begin to reorganize to form the spindle apparatus.\n\n3. Checkpoints:\n   - G1 checkpoint (also called the restriction point or START): Ensures the cell is ready to enter the S phase and replicate DNA. The cell assesses nutrient availability, DNA integrity, and growth signals before committing to division.  \n   - G2 checkpoint: Ensures that DNA replication during S phase has been completed correctly without damage and that the cell is ready to enter mitosis.\n\n4. DNA Content:\n   - G1 phase: The DNA content is normal (diploid), prior to replication.  \n   - G2 phase: The DNA has been replicated and consists of duplicated chromosomes (two sister chromatids), so the DNA content is effectively doubled, though the ploidy remains the same.\n\nIn summary:  \n- G1 is focused on cell growth and preparation for DNA replication.  \n- G2 is focused on preparation for mitosis after DNA has been replicated, including organelle division and spindle formation.",

For example, chlorine has two common isotopes: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37, which have mass numbers 35 and 37 respectively.\n\n- Relative Atomic Mass (Standard Atomic Weight): This is a weighted average of the atomic masses of all the naturally occurring isotopes of an element, weighted by their relative abundances.

To celebrate having worked off this debt, they paraded a straw-stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck and then threw it overboard. Since west-bound ships from Europe typically reached the subtropics around the time the \"dead horse\" was worked off, the latitude became associated with the ceremony.\n\nTwo other often cited explanations are:\n\n1. The term originates from when Spanish ships transporting horses became becalmed in these latitudes. Due to prolonged voyages and water shortages, crews had to throw dying or dead horses overboard.\n\n2. A maritime explanation where a ship was said to be \"horsed\" when it could make progress without wind by using strong ocean currents, similar to a rider on horseback.

It is a form of selective attention and often involves presenting true facts out of context to give a misleading impression.\n\nThe key difference is that cherry picking specifically involves the selection and presentation of particular pieces of evidence (such as statistics, quotes, or cases) to support an argument, whereas a one-sided argument broadly refers to the overall strategy of presenting only one side of an argument without acknowledging opposing views.\n\nIn summary:  \n- Cherry picking is a method of selecting evidence in a biased way.  \n- A one-sided argument uses this and other methods to present only supporting reasons, omitting opposing evidence.  \n\nCherry picking is often a technique used within a one-sided argument (card stacking) to achieve its persuasive effect.",

This incorporation is an integral part of the chemical structure, often involving direct bonding or coordination.\n\n- In clathrate hydrates, water forms a crystalline ice-like lattice that physically traps guest gas molecules (such as methane) within cavities, but there is no chemical bonding between the water molecules and the guest. The guest molecules are physically encaged by the water lattice.\n\nTherefore, while both involve water incorporated in a solid form, regular hydrates involve chemical association of water molecules with the compound, whereas clathrate hydrates involve water forming a host lattice trapping guest molecules without chemical bonding.",

This activation leads to a decrease in intracellular potassium and induces membrane hyperpolarization, resulting in activation of sperm movement.\n\n- In some mammals, sperm motility is activated by an increase in pH, calcium ions (Ca\u00b2\u207a), and cyclic AMP (cAMP).\n\nThus, while both sea urchins and some mammals involve an increase in pH for activation, sea urchins rely on ATPase activation and potassium decrease causing membrane hyperpolarization, whereas in mammals, calcium ions and cAMP also play crucial roles in activating sperm motility.",

This fusion brings together the \"BCR\" gene from chromosome 22 and the \"ABL1\" gene from chromosome 9, forming the \"BCR-ABL\" fusion gene.

Most of the rivers of this region are seasonal and dry up during summer season, therefore they cannot supply water to canals throughout the year.\n4. There are several streams which become torrential during rainy season, and the best way to use this water is to impound it by constructing embankments and building tanks; otherwise, this water would go to waste and into the sea.\n5.

Many tanks dry up during the dry season and fail to provide irrigation when it is most needed.\n2. Silting of the tank bed is a serious problem, requiring regular desilting.\n3. Much water is lost to evaporation from the large shallow water areas, reducing available irrigation water.\n4. Tanks cover large areas of cultivable land.\n5.

Bathing in the sacred waters of temple tanks is believed to cure worshippers of ailments and is part of religious practices.\n- Stepwells: Stepwells serve primarily as water sources and also as places for leisure and relief from heat. They provide access to groundwater through a series of descending steps and are often used for practical water needs.\n\nFeatures:\n- Temple Tanks: Temple tanks are reservoirs with steps leading down to the water, generally constructed within or near temple walls. They are often large, geometrically designed, and hold water that is considered sacred and used for ritual bathing.\n- Stepwells: Stepwells are wells with stairs that lead down to the water level. They may have significant ornamental and architectural features and often are located in urban or dwelling areas. Stepwells can be intricately designed and sometimes function as social gathering spots.\n\nRegional Prevalence:\n- Temple Tanks: These tanks are mainly found in South India. They are culturally significant in this region and common within South Indian temple architecture.\n- Stepwells: Stepwells are most commonly found in western India, such as Rajasthan and Gujarat.\n\nIn summary, temple tanks are sacred water reservoirs linked to temples and religious rituals prevalent in South India, whereas stepwells are functional and architectural structures providing water access and leisure spaces primarily in western India.",

Under the previous CBA, which expired in 2004, teams losing UFAs were awarded draft picks as compensation, but this is no longer the case.\n\nIn Major League Baseball (MLB), the situation is different. Under the current CBA signed in 2011 (effective from the 2012 season), MLB teams can receive draft-pick compensation for losing a free agent only if they make a qualifying offer to the player prior to free agency. The offer must be at least equal to the average salary of the top 125 richest contracts in MLB. If the player declines this qualifying offer and signs with another team, the original team may receive draft picks as compensation. If a player is traded during the final season of his contract, the new team is not eligible for draft-pick compensation upon losing that player.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- **NHL:** No draft-pick compensation for losing unrestricted free agents under the current CBA.\n- **MLB:** Draft-pick compensation is possible if the team extends a qualifying offer (at least equal to the average of the top 125 richest contracts) and the player declines it to sign elsewhere; no compensation if the player was traded during the final contract season.",

The colonizer's laughter is metaphorically described as \"ice-block laughter.\" This metaphor conveys that his laughter is cold, harsh, and freezing, which \"froze your inside, froze your voice, froze your ears, froze your eyes and froze your tongue.\" This suggests the colonizer\u2019s laughter is derisive, mocking, and emotionally cold, indicating a lack of understanding and empathy.\n\n2. In contrast, the African native's laughter is described as \"the fire of the eye of the sky, the fire of the earth, the fire of the air, the fire of the seas and the rivers fishes animals trees.\" This metaphor depicts the native's laughter as warm, natural, vibrant, and life-giving, representing deep wisdom, authenticity, and a connection to nature and tradition.\n\nThe change caused in the colonizer by the native's \"fire\" laughter is significant: it \"thawed your inside, thawed your voice, thawed your ears, thawed your eyes and thawed your tongue,\" implying that the cold, derisive laughter of the colonizer is softened and transformed by the warmth and sincerity of the native\u2019s laughter. This thawing leads to a \"meek wonder\" in the colonizer, prompting him to whisper \"Why so?\" and subsequently realize the ignorance of his previous derision. The colonizer comes to appreciate that the indigenous African beliefs and worldview are not primitive but are owned \"by the living warmth of the earth.\"\n\nThus, the metaphors of \"ice-block\" and \"fire\" laughter symbolize the contrast between cold mockery and warm understanding, resulting in the colonizer's awakening and recognition of the value of African culture.",
