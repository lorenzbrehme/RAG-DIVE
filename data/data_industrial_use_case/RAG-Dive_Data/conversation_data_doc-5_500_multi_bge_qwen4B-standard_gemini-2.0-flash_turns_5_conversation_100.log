Validation failed for title: Videoconferencing.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did PictureTel face any significant competition early on?', 'question': 'Besides AT&T, did PictureTel face any significant competition early on in the commercial videoconferencing market?', 'answer': "The document does not mention PictureTel's direct competition in the early commercial videoconferencing market.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer incorrectly states that the document does not mention any direct competition; the provided material references AT&T as an early competitor, so asserting no competition is mentioned is false. Additionally, the Answer did not address the 'besides AT&T' aspect of the Question.

Validation failed for title: Everton_F.C..md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Are you sure it wasn't Walter Smith?", 'question': 'Are you sure the Everton manager directly before David Moyes was Alan Smith and not Walter Smith?', 'answer': 'Walter Smith', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: Incorrect ground-truth: the manager directly before David Moyes was Alan Smith, not Walter Smith. For a Correction-type item, the Answer should be Alan Smith.

Validation failed for title: Everton_F.C..md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What position did they finish in the season before Moyes took over?', 'question': 'What league position did Everton finish in the season immediately before David Moyes became their manager?', 'answer': 'They were in danger of relegation', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The question asks for the exact league finish position of Everton in the season immediately before Moyes became manager. Everton finished 15th in the 2001–02 Premier League season, so the correct answer should be a numeric position (e.g., 15th). The provided answer, 'They were in danger of relegation,' is qualitative and does not specify the finish position.

Validation failed for title: Everton_F.C..md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So they finished 17th, but Moyes guided them to 15th the next season?', 'question': 'If Everton finished 17th the season before David Moyes took over, did David Moyes then guide them to a 15th place finish in his first full season?', 'answer': 'No, he guided them to a safe finish in fifteenth place.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The provided answer is incorrect. In Moyes' first full season (2002–03) Everton finished 7th, not 15th. Therefore the correct response is: No; he guided them to 7th place.

Validation failed for title: Hindu_philosophy.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned self-inquiry and meditation, but also understanding māyā. How are those three related in the process?', 'question': 'In Advaita Vedanta, how do self-inquiry, meditation on the self, and understanding māyā work together to facilitate the realization of atman = Brahman?', 'answer': 'Jīvanmukti (liberation during life) can be achieved through Self-knowledge, the understanding that ātman within is same as ātman in another person and all of Brahman – the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The answer omits the requested explanation of how self-inquiry, meditation on the self, and understanding māyā interact and contribute together toward realizing atman = Brahman; it only states that liberation is achieved through self-knowledge, without addressing māyā's role or the specific collaborative process among the three elements.

Validation failed for title: Hindu_philosophy.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, if the world is māyā, why should I bother doing anything?', 'question': 'According to Advaita Vedanta, if the world is māyā and ultimately unreal, what is the purpose of action and engagement in the world?', 'answer': 'Advaita Vedantins hold that dualities and misunderstanding of māyā as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering. Jīvanmukti (liberation during life) can be achieved through Self-knowledge, the understanding that ātman within is same as ātman in another person and all of Brahman – the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer does not address the question about the purpose of action and engagement in the world when the world is māyā. It only states that liberation is via self-knowledge and the identity of ātman with Brahman, but it does not explain how or why one should act (e.g., duties, ethical conduct, or acting without attachment as a means of sadhana). This makes it incomplete relative to the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Hokkien.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did this compare to the rise of Taiwanese?', 'question': 'Compared to the rise of the Amoy dialect, how did the Taiwanese dialect become prominent?', 'answer': 'Taiwanese is also a hybrid of the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects. Taiwanese in northern Taiwan tends to be based on the Quanzhou variety, whereas the Taiwanese spoken in southern Taiwan tends to be based on Zhangzhou speech. After the liberalization of language development and mother tongue movement in Taiwan, Taiwanese Hokkien had undergone a fast pace in its development. In 1993, Taiwan became the first region in the world to implement the teaching of Taiwanese Hokkien in Taiwanese schools. In 2001, the local Taiwanese language program was further extended to all schools in Taiwan, and Taiwanese Hokkien became one of the compulsory local Taiwanese languages to be learned in schools. Contact with the Japanese language has left a legacy of Japanese loanwords in Taiwanese Hokkien.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is not identical to 'rag_input'. For the first turn, the 'Question' must be exactly the same as the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Hokkien.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did this standardization affect the number of speakers?', 'question': 'Considering the Amoy and Taiwanese dialects and the standardization efforts for Taiwanese, did this standardization ultimately affect the number of Taiwanese speakers?', 'answer': 'In 1993, Taiwan became the first region in the world to implement the teaching of Taiwanese Hokkien in Taiwanese schools. In 2001, the local Taiwanese language program was further extended to all schools in Taiwan, and Taiwanese Hokkien became one of the compulsory local Taiwanese languages to be learned in schools.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not directly address whether standardization affected the number of speakers; it discusses policy dates (1993, 2001) and schooling without providing data or a conclusion about changes in speaker numbers.

Validation failed for title: Human_Development_Index.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Okay, maybe I wasn't clear. I'm asking about countries with a low HDI. Can you answer that?", 'question': 'Ignoring your previous statement, I am asking where countries with a low Human Development Index (HDI) are located. Can you answer that?', 'answer': 'All 22 countries in that category are located in Africa.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone: it relies on the prior turn ('Ignoring your previous statement') for context, so it cannot be understood without history. It violates Rule 2 (Question must be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input).

Validation failed for title: Human_Development_Index.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What HDI value defines that next category?', 'question': "What Human Development Index (HDI) value defines the 'medium development' category, which is the category above 'low development'?", 'answer': 'A HDI of 0.8 or more is considered to represent "high development".', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer identifies the threshold for 'high development' (HDI >= 0.8) instead of the threshold for the 'medium development' category. The correct range for 'medium development' is HDI from 0.5 up to (but not including) 0.8, i.e., 0.5–0.799...

Validation failed for title: Prime_minister.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, the title wasn't official until 1905, even though Disraeli used it in government documents?", 'question': "Given that the prime minister's title was used in government documents during Disraeli's time, but wasn't officially recognized until 1905, can you confirm that the formal British Order of Precedence did not include the prime minister position until 1905, despite earlier usage?", 'answer': 'The title was first referred to on government documents during the administration of Benjamin Disraeli but did not appear in the formal British Order of precedence until 1905.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question uses the phrase 'government documents,' which references documents and violates the rule that the Question must not refer to 'a document' or documents. This prevents the Question from being a standalone, document-free reformulation of the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Communication.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give an example of how noise affects the channel dimension specifically?', 'question': "Given that the dimensions of communication include a channel, and that noise can affect communication, can you provide a specific example of how 'communication noise' affects the channel dimension?", 'answer': 'In the presence of "communication noise" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer fails to provide a concrete example requested by the rag_input. It offers a general statement about noise causing faulty reception but does not illustrate a specific scenario on how noise affects the channel dimension (e.g., a particular channel type, noise characteristics, and resulting misinterpretation).

Validation failed for title: Communication.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does the constitutive model account for noise in comparison to the transmission model?', 'question': 'Given the discussion of communication models (transmission and constitutive) and the concept of noise, how does the constitutive model handle or account for the presence and effects of noise, especially in contrast to how the transmission model addresses noise?', 'answer': 'In a simple model, often referred to as the transmission model or standard view of communication, information or content (e.g. a message in natural language) is sent in some form (as spoken language) from an emisor/ sender/ encoder to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. This common conception of communication simply views communication as a means of sending and receiving information...In a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked reciprocally. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted...In the presence of "communication noise" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The 'Question' relies on ongoing discussion rather than being fully standalone and self-contained. The 'Answer' does not clearly explain how the constitutive model handles or accounts for noise, and instead reiterates general points about transmission noise and interpretation without providing a concrete comparative explanation of the constitutive model's treatment of noise.

Validation failed for title: Communication.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How would you apply the constitutive model to animal communication?', 'question': "Given the explanation of the constitutive model of communication, how can this model be applied to understand and analyze communication between animals, considering factors such as shared context, interpretation, and potential 'noise' in their interactions?", 'answer': 'The broad field of animal communication encompasses most of the issues in ethology. Animal communication can be defined as any behavior of one animal that affects the current or future behavior of another animal. The study of animal communication, called zoo semiotics (distinguishable from anthroposemiotics, the study of human communication) has played an important part in the development of ethology, sociobiology, and the study of animal cognition. Animal communication, and indeed the understanding of the animal world in general, is a rapidly growing field, and even in the 21st century so far, a great share of prior understanding related to diverse fields such as personal symbolic name use, animal emotions, animal culture and learning, and even sexual conduct, long thought to be well understood, has been revolutionized. A special field of animal communication has been investigated in more detail such as vibrational communication.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not fully standalone: it references 'the explanation' of the constitutive model, which relies on prior conversation. Additionally, the Answer does not provide a concrete application of the constitutive model to animal communication, but rather gives general background on animal communication rather than actionable or specific analysis steps.

Validation failed for title: Sichuan.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which other regions are known for wine production?', 'question': 'Besides Sichuan, which other regions in China are known for wine production?', 'answer': "The provided document doesn't contain information about other regions in China that produce wine.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the Question. It states that information is unavailable in a document, rather than providing the actual regions known for wine production besides Sichuan. The Answer should be a factual response naming other regions (or clearly indicating that such information is not available) without referencing documents.

Validation failed for title: Sichuan.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did wine production increase or decrease after 2000?', 'question': "Following 2000, did Sichuan's wine production increase or decrease?", 'answer': 'The document does not provide information about wine production trends after 2000.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references a document, which violates the instruction to never mention that a document was provided. Additionally, the Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input (it adds 'Sichuan' and assumes prior context), so it fails the standalone-rephrase requirement.

Validation failed for title: Sichuan.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What other industries are prominent in Yibin?', 'question': 'Besides wine, what other industries are particularly prominent in Yibin, Sichuan?', 'answer': 'According to the document, Yibin is a production center for machinery and metallurgical industries.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer incorrectly states that Yibin is a production center for machinery and metallurgical industries. The document identifies Yibin as the wine production center (with Deyang and Panzhihua corresponding to machinery and metallurgical industries, respectively). Since the Question asks for other industries besides wine in Yibin, the provided Answer is factually incorrect.

Validation failed for title: Appalachian_Mountains.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does that compare to Mount Mitchell?', 'question': 'What is the elevation of Mount Mitchell compared to the elevation of Mount Rogers, which is 5,729 ft (1,746 m)?', 'answer': 'Mount Mitchell is 6,684 feet (2,037 m).', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer should provide the comparative information requested by the Question. The provided Answer only states Mount Mitchell's elevation (6,684 ft / 2,037 m) and omits the comparison to Mount Rogers (5,729 ft / 1,746 m) and the difference (955 ft / 291 m).

Validation failed for title: BBC_Television.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What were the initial broadcast times?', 'question': 'Following the start of regular broadcasts from Alexandra Palace in London on November 2, 1936, what were the initial broadcast times for BBC Television?', 'answer': 'BBC television initially broadcast Monday to Saturday from 15:00 to 16:00 and 21:00 to 22:00.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is too generic and not clearly built on the prior turn. It lacks the necessary contextual connection (e.g., referencing the Alexandra Palace start date or the specific event) that the rule requires. A better RAG_input would explicitly tie to the prior context, such as: 'Following the start of regular BBC Television broadcasts on 2 November 1936 from Alexandra Palace, what were the initial broadcast times?'

Validation failed for title: Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any other territorial changes around that time?', 'question': 'Besides annexing territories around Ivangorod, the Pechorsky and Pytalovsky Districts and gaining control over southern Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands, were there any other territorial changes involving the Russian SFSR around 1944-1945?', 'answer': 'Yes, on April 17, 1946, the Kaliningrad Oblast — the northern portion of the former German province of East Prussia—was annexed by the Soviet Union and made part of the Russian SFSR.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a faithful standalone rephrase of the RAG_input. It adds specific territorial details (around Ivangorod, the Pechorsky and Pytalovsky Districts, and southern Sakhalin/Kuril Islands) that were not present in the RAG_input, making it not self-contained as a rephrasing. A compliant version would restate the query without introducing new specifics, e.g., 'What other territorial changes occurred involving the Russian SFSR around 1944–1945?'

Validation failed for title: Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about Kaliningrad?', 'question': "Following the discussion about the Russian SFSR's annexation of territories after reconquering Estonia and Latvia and the question of other territorial changes around that time, what is the story with Kaliningrad and its relation to these events?", 'answer': 'On April 17, 1946, the Kaliningrad Oblast — the northern portion of the former German province of East Prussia—was annexed by the Soviet Union and made part of the Russian SFSR.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrase of the RAG_input. It relies on prior conversation context ('Following the discussion...'), making it not understandable without history. A compliant version would restate the RAG_input as a self-contained question like: 'What other territorial changes involving the Russian SFSR occurred around 1944–1945, aside from reconquering Estonia and Latvia?'

Validation failed for title: Estonian_language.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which of those languages has influenced Estonian the most?', 'question': 'Considering the various languages mentioned as sources of loanwords that have enriched the Estonian language, which of those languages has had the most significant influence on Estonian?', 'answer': 'Estonian has been influenced by Swedish, German (initially Middle Low German, which was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League and spoken natively in the territories of what is today known as Estonia by a sizeable burgher community of Baltic Germans, later Estonian was also influenced by standard German), and Russian, though it is not related to them genetically.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not specify which of the languages (Swedish, German, Russian) had the most significant influence on Estonian, as the Question requires; it merely lists several influences without ranking or selecting a single most influential language.

Validation failed for title: Estonian_language.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did German influence the Estonian sound system?', 'question': 'Given that German had the most significant impact on the structure and development of the Estonian language, how specifically did German influence the Estonian sound system or phonology?', 'answer': 'The Estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from Germanic languages, mainly from Low Saxon (Middle Low German) during the period of German rule, and High German (including standard German). The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22–25 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The question asks for specific influence on Estonian phonology (sound system). The answer discusses vocabulary loanwords and their percentages, not phonological changes or how German influenced Estonian sounds, making it incorrect with respect to the prompt.

Validation failed for title: Mesozoic.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What effect did these sea level changes have on animal life?', 'question': 'Given the fluctuating sea levels during the Mesozoic, what effect did these changes have on animal life, specifically marine life?', 'answer': 'The Early Cretaceous saw the expansion of seaways, and as a result, the decline and extinction of sauropods (except in South America). Many coastal shallows were created, and that caused Ichthyosaurs to die out. Mosasaurs evolved to replace them as head of the seas. Some island-hopping dinosaurs, like Eustreptospondylus, evolved to cope with the coastal shallows and small islands of ancient Europe.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer contains factual inaccuracies and unsupported claims: 1) Sauropods did not globally decline and go extinct in the Early Cretaceous except in South America; they persisted in other regions into the Late Cretaceous. 2) The claim that island-hopping dinosaurs like Eustreptospondylus coped with coastal shallows and small islands is incorrect; Eustreptospondylus is an Early Jurassic land-dwelling theropod, not an example of marine or coastal adaptation. 3) While ichthyosaurs declined and mosasaurs became prominent later, the answer mixes marine and terrestrial lineages and provides an imprecise narrative for marine life responses to sea-level rise. In short, the answer is not an accurate or reliable summary of marine life responses to Mesozoic sea-level changes.

Validation failed for title: BeiDou_Navigation_Satellite_System.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What is AutoNavi's role then?", 'question': "Since the document does not specify how China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, AutoNavi Holdings Ltd, and China North Industries Group Corp benefit from the BeiDou system, what is known about AutoNavi Holdings Ltd's role in relation to the BeiDou system?", 'answer': "The document doesn't specify AutoNavi's role.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question rephrase references 'the document' (i.e., 'the document does not specify...'), which makes it non-standalone and violates Rule 2. The Question must be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input without referring to any document or prior history.

Validation failed for title: BeiDou_Navigation_Satellite_System.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about the other two, then?', 'question': "Since the document does not specify AutoNavi's role in the BeiDou system, what information is available regarding the roles of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp and China North Industries Group Corp within the BeiDou system?", 'answer': "The document doesn't specify the roles of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp and China North Industries Group Corp, either.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not self-contained; it refers to 'the document' and AutoNavi's role, which ties it to prior history. Rule 2 requires the Question to be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input, understandable without references to documents or past turns.

Validation failed for title: Materialism.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is that view of materialism similar to atheism?', 'question': "According to the Catholic Encyclopedia's definition of materialism, which states that materialism regards matter as the only reality and denies the existence of God and the soul, is this view of materialism similar to atheism?", 'answer': 'In such a context one can conflate materialism with atheism.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' reuses an explicit reference to a document ('Catholic Encyclopedia'), which violates the requirement that the standalone Question not refer to any document and be self-contained.

Validation failed for title: Materialism.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, is Brahman considered matter?', 'question': 'If Maya is the illusion of the material world, and it hides the true reality, Brahman, is Brahman itself considered a form of matter?', 'answer': 'Maya gets destroyed for a person when s/he perceives Brahman with transcendental knowledge.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the standalone Question. The Question asks whether Brahman is considered matter; the provided Answer discusses Maya being destroyed upon perceiving Brahman and does not state Brahman's ontological status with respect to matter.

Validation failed for title: Rule_of_law.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did ancient Greek philosophers view the rule of law?', 'question': 'Considering our discussion of the rule of law in various countries, including East Asian nations, how did ancient Greek philosophers view the rule of law?', 'answer': 'The ancient Greeks initially regarded the best form of government as rule by the best men. Plato advocated a benevolent monarchy ruled by an idealized philosopher king, who was above the law. Plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws, explaining that "Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state." More than Plato attempted to do, Aristotle flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws. In other words, Aristotle advocated the rule of law', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone restatement of the rag_input; it references prior discussion and East Asian nations, making it non-self-contained. In the first turn, the 'Question' should be identical to the rag_input (self-contained), per the required format.

Validation failed for title: Paper.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Does the machine used to make wove paper affect its density?', 'question': "Does the machine used to make wove paper affect the paper's density?", 'answer': 'Yes, the wire mesh used in the Fourdrinier Machine, which produces wove paper, leaves a pattern that has the same density along the paper grain and across the grain.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input; the rules require the Question to be a standalone rephrasing that is not a verbatim copy of the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Paper.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, if the fiber distribution remains uniform even with additives, does the type of additive affect other characteristics of the paper, like its strength or how well it prints?', 'question': 'Given that the fiber distribution in wove paper remains uniform despite the addition of fillers, do different types of additives impact other properties of the paper, such as its strength or print quality?', 'answer': 'Besides the fibres, pulps may contain fillers such as chalk or china clay, which improve its characteristics for printing or writing.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided Answer does not fully address the Question. The Question asks whether different types of additives impact other properties such as strength or print quality; the Answer only states that fillers can improve printing or writing and does not compare additive types or discuss effects on strength or print quality in detail.

Validation failed for title: Circadian_rhythm.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, are there any interventions that can help shift workers realign their circadian rhythms?', 'question': 'Given the discussion about the specific genes affected by circadian misalignment due to shift work, are there any known interventions that can help shift workers realign their disrupted circadian rhythms and mitigate the negative health effects?', 'answer': 'Unclear from the document. While the document discusses the impacts of shift work and potential mechanisms, it does not specifically detail interventions to realign circadian rhythms.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input; it introduces new context about 'the discussion about specific genes' which is not present in the RAG_input. This violates the requirement that the Question be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input. Additionally, the Answer is not factually correct given prior content, which indicates that timing of food intake can influence circadian alignment and metabolic health (i.e., there is information about interventions like meal timing), so stating 'Unclear from the document' is misleading.

Validation failed for title: England_national_football_team.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who was the manager then?', 'question': 'Who was the manager of the England national football team when they won the World Cup in 1966?', 'answer': 'The document does not specify the manager of the England team in 1966.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer is factually incorrect. England's manager during the 1966 World Cup was Alf Ramsey. The provided answer falsely claims the manager is not specified.

Validation failed for title: England_national_football_team.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did he manage them at any other World Cups?', 'question': 'Besides the 1966 World Cup, did Alf Ramsey manage the England national football team at any other World Cup tournaments?', 'answer': "England qualified for the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico as reigning champions, and reached the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by West Germany. England had been 2–0 up, but were eventually beaten 3–2 after extra time. They failed in qualification for the 1974, leading to Ramsey's dismissal, and 1978 FIFA World Cups.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to the 'rag_input' and does not provide a standalone paraphrase. It should be a rephrased, self-contained version of the prompt, not a verbatim copy.

Validation failed for title: England_national_football_team.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Why was he dismissed?', 'question': 'Following his management of the England national team in the 1966 and 1970 World Cups, why was Sir Alf Ramsey dismissed from his position?', 'answer': "They failed in qualification for the 1974, leading to Ramsey's dismissal, and 1978 FIFA World Cups.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer incorrectly states that Alf Ramsey was dismissed due to failures to qualify for both the 1974 and 1978 World Cups. In reality, Ramsey was dismissed in 1974 after England failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup; he was no longer England manager by 1978.

Validation failed for title: England_national_football_team.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who replaced him?', 'question': "Following Sir Alf Ramsey's departure as manager of the England national team after their failure to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, who was appointed as his replacement?", 'answer': 'The document does not explicitly state who replaced Ramsey as England manager, but it does mention that Ron Greenwood later managed the team and qualified them for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer is factually incorrect: the material indicates that Ron Greenwood later managed the England team, implying he was Ramsey's successor, so stating that the replacement isn’t specified is wrong. (The Question adds context, but the core issue is the incorrect factual claim about the replacement.)

Validation failed for title: Lancashire.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you tell me more about the folk music revival?', 'question': "Based on the information provided about Lancashire's musical history, can you provide more details about the folk music revival that occurred in the county?", 'answer': "In the 20th century, there was a revival of interest in Lancashire's folk music traditions. This revival was led by figures like Ewan MacColl and Harry Boardman, who played a significant role in popularizing and recording the folk music of the county. In the late 20th century, groups such as Liverpool’s The Spinners and Manchester’s Roy Harper and Mike Harding helped bring regional folk music to a wider audience. During this period, numerous folk clubs were established, many of which focused on Irish and Scottish traditions. The Fylde Folk Festival in Fleetwood is a regular event that celebrates folk music.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone. It references 'the information provided about Lancashire's musical history' from a prior turn, which violates the requirement that the Question be self-contained. A standalone rephrase would ask directly about the revival without referencing documents or prior conversation.

Validation failed for title: Lancashire.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any particular songs that became emblematic of that revival?', 'question': 'Considering the folk music revival in Lancashire, can you identify any specific songs that were particularly representative or became widely recognized symbols of that movement?', 'answer': 'While the document mentions folk songs like "The Lancashire Miller," "Warrington Ale," "The soldier\'s farewell to Manchester," "The Leaving of Liverpool" and "Maggie May" as common folk songs in Lancashire, and mentions industrial-era songs like "The Miner’s Lament" or "The Weavers’ Song" as becoming central to the revival\'s identity, it doesn\'t explicitly state which songs became *emblematic* of the revival.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document' as a source, which violates the requirement to avoid mentioning that a document was provided.

Validation failed for title: Lancashire.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any folk clubs that became particularly well-known?', 'question': "Within Lancashire's folk music revival, were there any specific folk clubs that gained a particularly high level of recognition or influence?", 'answer': 'The document mentions folk clubs across Lancashire, especially in Liverpool, Manchester, and the Fylde coast, but it does not specify which clubs were particularly well-known. It does mention the Fylde Folk Festival in Fleetwood, which originated in local club culture.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer refers to 'The document' as a source, which violates the requirement to avoid mentioning documents/sources. Answers should be self-contained and not reference retrieval or provided documents.

Validation failed for title: Old_English.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, how did Mercian gain prominence?', 'question': 'West Saxon was the literary standard of Old English, but Mercian became the source of spoken language leading to Middle and Modern English. So, how did Mercian gain prominence?', 'answer': "Due to the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions, there is relatively little written record of the non-Wessex dialects after Alfred's unification. Some Mercian texts continued to be written, however, and the influence of Mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under Alfred's programme, many of which were produced by Mercian scholars. Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken, as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in Middle and Modern English.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a faithful standalone rephrase of the rag_input. It adds extra contextual content ('West Saxon was the literary standard...') that goes beyond a direct restatement of 'So, how did Mercian gain prominence?' The requirement is that the Question should be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input; this one introduces additional context and is not a strict rephrase.

Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What causes those deaths?', 'question': 'Given the high mortality rate associated with diarrhea, especially in children, what are the primary causes of those deaths?', 'answer': 'It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer discusses duration and dehydration signs but fails to clearly identify dehydration (and electrolyte disturbances) as the primary cause of diarrhea-related deaths, nor mention other major causes; thus it does not adequately answer the question.

Validation failed for title: Myocardial_infarction.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are the major risk factors that contribute to a myocardial infarction?', 'question': 'Considering both immediate and long-term treatments for myocardial infarction, what are the primary risk factors that increase the likelihood of experiencing one in the first place?', 'answer': 'Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake, among others.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The RAG_input does not clearly build on the prior turn; it asks about MI risk factors in isolation rather than as a direct follow-up to the previous discussion about MI treatments. While the topic is related and the answer is factually correct, the contextual continuity requirement (RAG_input must clearly build on the prior turn) is not satisfied.

Validation failed for title: Myocardial_infarction.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What are the most common symptoms that might lead someone to suspect they're having a myocardial infarction and seek medical attention?", 'question': "Considering the tests and diagnostic procedures for myocardial infarction, what are the most frequent symptoms that would prompt a person to suspect they're experiencing one and therefore seek medical help?", 'answer': 'The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a faithful standalone rephrase of the rag_input. It introduces 'Considering the tests and diagnostic procedures' and shifts the focus from symptoms prompting medical attention to diagnostic context, which violates the requirement that the Question be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Phonology.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's an archiphoneme, then?", 'question': "Given that Trubetzkoy expanded on de Courtenay's work and introduced the concept of the archiphoneme, what is an archiphoneme?", 'answer': 'Trubetzkoy also developed the concept of the archiphoneme.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not define or explain what an archiphoneme is; it only states that Trubetzkoy developed the concept, which does not answer the standalone question.

Validation failed for title: Phonology.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Why were archiphonemes abandoned in modern phonology?', 'question': 'Given that archiphonemes were revolutionary in early phonology but largely abandoned in modern phonology like Optimality Theory and Generative Phonology, why were they abandoned?', 'answer': 'In 1968 Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle published The Sound Pattern of English (SPE), the basis for generative phonology. In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer is incomplete: archiphonemes were not abandoned solely because SPE popularized generative phonology. While generative/segmental approaches reduced emphasis on archiphonemes, a major factor was the rise of autosegmental phonology (and later nonlinear frameworks like OT) that modeled context-sensitive variation using multiple tiers and morphophonological rules. The provided answer omits these developments and overattributes the shift to SPE alone.

Validation failed for title: Great_power.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give an example of a nation considered a regional power?', 'question': 'Following our discussion on the difference between great powers and regional powers, can you provide an example of a nation that is typically considered a regional power?', 'answer': 'The document does not directly provide examples of regional powers.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Multiple violations: (1) The rag_input does not clearly build on the prior turn and lacks explicit context connecting to the previous discussion. (2) The Question is not a proper standalone rephrasing and still relies on prior conversation context. (3) The Answer does not provide a correct ground-truth example but instead states that the document does not provide one, which is not the appropriate answer to the asked question. (4) The Answer references a document, which is prohibited by the rules.

Validation failed for title: Great_power.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Are there any nations that used to be considered great powers but aren't anymore?", 'question': "Considering that a nation's status as a great power depends on a combination of military, economic, and soft power, are there any examples of nations that were previously considered great powers but have since lost that status?", 'answer': 'Yes, the document mentions that some authorities began to question if France and the United Kingdom could retain their long-held statuses as great powers during the Cold War. The Austria-Hungarian empire was divided into new, less powerful states after World War I.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document', which violates the rule to ground the Answer in the RAG_input / standalone question without mentioning sources. Additionally, the claim about France and the United Kingdom losing great-power status during the Cold War is debatable; a clearer example would be Austria-Hungary, but the Answer should be self-contained and not rely on external documents.

Validation failed for title: Spanish_language_in_the_United_States.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about Nicaraguans, what caused them to migrate?', 'question': 'Besides the Salvadorans civil war in the 1980s, what were the reasons that caused Nicaraguans to migrate to the United States?', 'answer': 'The migration of Spanish-speaking Nicaraguans also began as a result of political instability during the end of the 1970s and the 1980s. The uprising of the Sandinista revolution which toppled the Somoza dictatorship in 1979 caused many Nicaraguans to migrate particularly from those opposing the Sandinistas. Throughout the 1980s with the United States supported Contra War (or Contra-revolutionary war) which continued up until 1988, and the economic collapse of the country many more Nicaraguans migrated to the United States amongst other countries.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrase of the rag_input; it introduces Salvadorans context ('Besides the Salvadorans civil war...') and is not self-contained, violating the requirement to base the question solely on the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Spanish_language_in_the_United_States.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any attempts to force Puerto Ricans to speak English?', 'question': 'Besides the migrations of people from El Salvador and Nicaragua, were there also attempts to force Puerto Ricans to speak English?', 'answer': 'For decades, the U.S. federal government strenuously tried to force Puerto Ricans to adopt English, to the extent of making them use English as the primary language of instruction in their high schools. It was completely unsuccessful, and retreated from that policy in 1948. Puerto Rico was able to maintain its Spanish language, culture, and identity because the relatively small, densely populated island was already home to nearly a million people at the time of the U.S. takeover, all of those spoke Spanish, and the territory was never hit with a massive influx of millions of English speakers like the vast territory acquired from Mexico 50 years earlier.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrase of the 'rag_input'; it introduces unrelated context about migrations from El Salvador and Nicaragua and asks about that, which makes it not self-contained. The 'Question' should be a self-contained restatement of 'Were there any attempts to force Puerto Ricans to speak English?' without referencing other migration events.

Validation failed for title: Spanish_language_in_the_United_States.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did that compare to what happened in Texas?', 'question': 'Following the failed attempts to force English on Puerto Ricans, how did language policy in Texas compare?', 'answer': "In Texas, English is the state's de facto official language (though it lacks de jure status) and is used in government. However, the continual influx of Spanish-speaking immigrants increased the import of Spanish in Texas. Texas's counties bordering Mexico are mostly Hispanic, and consequently, Spanish is commonly spoken in the region. The Government of Texas, through Section 2054.116 of the Government Code, mandates that state agencies provide information on their websites in Spanish to assist residents who have limited English proficiency. Through the force of sheer numbers, the English-speaking American settlers entering the Southwest established their language, culture, and law as dominant, to the extent it fully displaced Spanish in the public sphere; this is why the United States never developed bilingualism as Canada did.", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone restatement of the rag_input; it presumes prior context about 'the failed attempts to force English on Puerto Ricans' and thus does not stand on its own. Additionally, the Answer makes sweeping historical claims (e.g., that the U.S. never developed bilingualism as Canada did and that Spanish was fully displaced in the public sphere) which are inaccurate or oversimplified (e.g., New Mexico has bilingual provisions, and Texas/California have sustained Spanish use in various domains).

Validation failed for title: Neoclassical_architecture.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did their style compare to the Empire style in France?', 'question': "Considering the Adam brothers' contributions to Neoclassical architecture, how did their style in Britain compare to the Empire style that was developing in France around the same time?", 'answer': "While both were Neoclassical, the Adam style emphasized lighter, more elegant designs, simplifying Rococo and Baroque elements. The Empire style in France, however, was more grandiose and based on Imperial Roman styles, intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state.", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input instead of being a standalone rephrasing; also the Type 'Comparative' does not align with the question, which is not asking for a comparison.

Validation failed for title: Neoclassical_architecture.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What were some of the specific classical motifs they used indoors?', 'question': 'Given that the Adam brothers significantly influenced interior design by incorporating classical elements, what were some of the specific classical motifs that they commonly used in their interior designs?', 'answer': 'They introduced classical motifs such as stucco reliefs, symmetrical room layouts, domed ceilings, and columned halls into domestic spaces. They also used classical forms in a domestic context—such as pedimented window frames turned into gilded mirrors or fireplaces topped with temple fronts.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' should be identical to the 'rag_input' for the first turn. Here, the 'Question' is a rephrased, standalone version that adds context not present in the exact rag_input, violating the required format.

Validation failed for title: Swaziland.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'I thought there were some?', 'question': 'Are there any Jewish people living in Swaziland, and if so, how many families?', 'answer': 'There are 14 Jewish families.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The declared Type is Correction, but the RAG_input appears to be a brief follow-up fragment rather than a correction of a previous answer. The appropriate Type would likely be Follow-up or Clarification. Additionally, while the Question can standalone, the mismatch between the Type and the content prevents it from satisfying the validation rules.

Validation failed for title: Swaziland.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So the 1% for Islam is significantly larger?', 'question': 'Given that you stated there are effectively zero Jewish families, is the 1% of the population following Islam a significantly larger religious demographic in Swaziland?', 'answer': 'Yes', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone: it relies on prior context (the claim about effectively zero Jewish families) and cannot be understood without previous turns. The RAG_input is 'So the 1% for Islam is significantly larger?', which should be reframed into a self-contained question that does not reference earlier statements.

Validation failed for title: Translation.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "How did the standardization of German from Luther's Bible influence other languages?", 'question': "Given the discussion about Martin Luther's Bible translation and its impact on standardizing the German language, how did this standardization of German influence the development or standardization of other languages?", 'answer': 'The Tyndale New Testament (1525) was influenced by Luther. The King James Version (1611) followed his model of clarity and theological precision. Even modern Bible translations aim to balance accuracy with readability—something Luther pioneered.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer introduces unsupported claims and misses the requested focus. It asserts that the Tyndale New Testament (1525) was influenced by Luther and that the King James Version (1611) followed Luther's model, which are not directly relevant to how Luther's German standardization influenced other languages. It also neglects discussion of cross-language impacts (e.g., how vernacular translations across Europe were shaped by Luther’s approach) and instead centers on English translations, making it not aligned with the RAG_input's focus.

Validation failed for title: Translation.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did these vernacular translations impact the power structures of the time?', 'question': 'Given the discussion of vernacular Bible translations inspired by Luther and their spread across Europe, how did these vernacular translations generally impact the existing power structures and social hierarchies of the time?', 'answer': 'With the Bible now available in German, *every* person could read it. This democratized literacy. Suddenly, schools and families saw a need to teach reading and writing in German—not just Latin.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer contains an overgeneralization: it claims that 'every person could read it,' which is not historically accurate. While vernacular translations democratized literacy and influenced power structures by expanding access to scripture and education, literacy rates were still uneven and not universal. The response should acknowledge broader, nuanced impacts (e.g., shifts in clergy authority, regional literacy variation, and cross-language effects) rather than asserting universal literacy and focusing solely on German.

Validation failed for title: Translation.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, were there any regions where the religious institutions managed to maintain their authority despite vernacular translations?', 'question': 'Given the discussion on how vernacular Bible translations challenged religious institutions, were there any specific regions or countries where the religious institutions managed to maintain their authority and control despite the presence and availability of vernacular translations of the Bible?', 'answer': 'Despite occasional theoretical diversity, the actual practice of translation has hardly changed since antiquity. Except for some extreme metaphrasers in the early Christian period and the Middle Ages, and adapters in various periods (especially pre-Classical Rome, and the 18th century), translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking equivalents — "literal" where possible, paraphrastic where necessary — for the original meaning and other crucial "values" (e.g., style, verse form, concordance with musical accompaniment or, in films, with speech articulatory movements) as determined from context.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the rag_input/question. It focuses on general translation practices and fidelity rather than identifying regions where religious institutions maintained authority despite vernacular translations, which is what the question asks.

Validation failed for title: Neolithic.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What kind of pottery designs did they use?', 'question': 'You mentioned the Halaf culture. What kind of pottery designs did they use?', 'answer': 'The Halaf culture is known for its distinctive pottery, which often featured intricate geometric patterns and was typically painted in black or red with white or dark brown designs.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references prior discussion ('You mentioned the Halaf culture') and thus relies on history. It should be a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input, e.g., 'What kinds of pottery designs did the Halaf culture use?' rather than referencing previous turns.

Validation failed for title: Grape.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, are there particular types of white grapes that are better for making wine with at least some health benefits?', 'question': 'Given that some white wines can have more antioxidant benefits than others because of winemaking choices, are there particular types or cultivars of white grapes that are inherently better suited for making wine with at least some health benefits?', 'answer': 'White grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape. Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the Question. The RAG_input asks about health-benefit potential of white grape cultivars for winemaking, but the Answer discusses grape color genetics (white grapes being green and mutations affecting anthocyanin production) rather than health-related properties or cultivars.

Validation failed for title: Grape.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are table grapes cultivated with similar considerations for polyphenol content?', 'question': 'Given that certain wine grapes, both red and white, are cultivated with specific considerations for maximizing polyphenol content and potential health benefits, are table grapes also cultivated with similar attention to their polyphenol content, or are other factors the primary focus?', 'answer': 'Table grape cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit with relatively thin skin.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The response does not address polyphenol content or cultivation focus; it only mentions fruit size/skin traits, which is not answering whether table grapes are cultivated with attention to polyphenols or other factors.

Validation failed for title: Genome.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "You mentioned gene duplication. How often does this happen and what's the process?", 'question': 'In the context of discussing factors indicating biological complexity beyond genome size, you mentioned gene duplication as a driver of evolutionary innovation. Can you elaborate on the frequency of gene duplication events and describe the process by which they occur?', 'answer': 'Duplications play a major role in shaping the genome. Duplication may range from extension of short tandem repeats, to duplication of a cluster of genes, and all the way to duplication of entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. Such duplications are probably fundamental to the creation of genetic novelty.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the requested frequency of gene duplication events or describe the molecular/process mechanisms by which duplications occur. It only provides a general statement about the range of duplication sizes and their role, lacking frequency data and specific mechanisms (e.g., unequal crossing over, replication-based duplication, transposon-mediated duplication, or whole-genome duplication) called for by the Question.

Validation failed for title: Genome.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are the implications of whole-genome duplication?', 'question': 'Given the various mechanisms of gene duplication discussed, including whole-genome duplication, what are the broader consequences and implications of an organism undergoing whole-genome duplication?', 'answer': 'Such duplications are probably fundamental to the creation of genetic novelty.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrase of the rag_input. It relies on prior discussion by saying 'Given the various mechanisms ... discussed' and should be self-contained without referencing previous conversations. It should restate the rag_input in a self-contained way. Additionally, while the Answer is a reasonable high-level statement, the primary compliance issue is the lack of a self-contained Question.

Validation failed for title: Hanover.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What kind of marksmen participate?', 'question': 'Regarding the Schützenfest Hannover and its parade of marksmen, what kinds of marksmen typically participate in the event?', 'answer': 'The parade includes around 5,000 marksmen among the 12,000 participants from all over the world.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question asks for the kinds of marksmen that participate in the Schützenfest Hannover parade (i.e., the types/categories of marksmen). The provided Answer only mentions a participant count and global origin, but does not specify the kinds or categories of marksmen. Therefore it does not satisfy the requirement.

Validation failed for title: Comprehensive_school.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What replaced secondary modern schools?', 'question': 'Following the implementation of Circular 10/65 by Anthony Crosland, what type of school largely replaced secondary modern schools?', 'answer': 'Comprehensive schools', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input does not clearly build on the prior turn or include the necessary context to be contextually connected; it is standalone and does not reference Circular 10/65 or Anthony Crosland, which violates the requirement that RAG_input be contextually connected to the prior discussion.

Validation failed for title: Central_Intelligence_Agency.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "How did that compare to the National Security Agency's budget that year?", 'question': "In 2013, the CIA's budget was $14.7 billion, representing 28% of the total non-military intelligence budget. How did the CIA's 2013 budget compare to the National Security Agency's budget in 2013?", 'answer': "The CIA's fiscal 2013 budget of $14.7 billion was almost 50% more than the budget of the National Security Agency.", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a proper standalone rephrasing of the provided rag_input. It adds additional numerical context (CIA budget figure and percentage) that is not in the rag_input and requires prior content to interpret, instead of being a self-contained restatement like 'How did the CIA's 2013 budget compare to the NSA's 2013 budget?' Ensure the question is a standalone paraphrase of the rag_input with no extra data.

Validation failed for title: Data_compression.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Given the emphasis on decompression speed, is there a theoretical limit to how fast decompression can be, and what factors influence it?', 'question': 'Given that DEFLATE is optimized for fast decompression, and decompression speed is often emphasized, is there a theoretical limit to how fast decompression can be, and what factors influence it?', 'answer': 'I am sorry, but the document does not provide an explicit discussion of the theoretical limits of decompression speed. The document mentions that the speed of compression is proportional to the number of operations required by the algorithm. Also, latency is the number of samples analyzed before audio is processed.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is identical to 'rag_input'. The guidelines require the Question to be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input, self-contained and not identical to it (except for the first turn). This copy-paste duplication violates that requirement. The Type and 'Answer' are otherwise acceptable, but the primary issue is the Question duplication.

Validation failed for title: Letter_case.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So Cyrillic sometimes uses case, but not formally?', 'question': 'Based on our discussion, does Cyrillic sometimes use upper and lower case letters, but not in a formally standardized way?', 'answer': 'While Cyrillic *can* be written in uppercase or lowercase, it is **not used in practice** for formal writing in most modern contexts. In fact, in many official documents, Cyrillic text is always in lowercase or in a single form. Uppercase is used only occasionally (e.g., for emphasis or headings).', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone: it references 'our discussion' and relies on prior history. It should be a self-contained restatement of the rag_input without meta references. Additionally, while it aims to rephrase the rag_input, the inclusion of history cues means it does not meet the requirement for a self-contained restatement.

Validation failed for title: Letter_case.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, modern Georgian is mostly unicameral?', 'question': 'Given the discussion about letter cases, is it accurate to say that the modern Georgian alphabet is predominantly unicameral, primarily using only one case?', 'answer': 'Georgian alphabet is special since it used to be bicameral, but today is mostly used in a unicameral way.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is not fully standalone; it references 'the discussion about letter cases' rather than restating the rag_input in a self-contained way. A compliant version would restate the rag_input as a standalone question without history references, e.g., 'Is the modern Georgian alphabet predominantly unicameral with only one case used in ordinary writing?'.

Validation failed for title: Federal_Aviation_Administration.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, the TSA took over their airport security role?', 'question': "Given the FAA's enhanced security measures after 9/11, did the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) eventually assume primary responsibility for airport security, effectively taking over the FAA's role in that area?", 'answer': 'In response to the hijackings on September 11, 2001, this responsibility is now primarily taken by the Department of Homeland Security.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The answer attributes the transfer to the Department of Homeland Security but does not explicitly state that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) took over primary airport security responsibilities. The question asks about TSA specifically; the answer should indicate that TSA (as part of DHS) assumed those duties, not just DHS in general.

Validation failed for title: States_of_Germany.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What kind of policy responsibilities does this enable?', 'question': 'Given that Article 28(2) of the Basic Law guarantees municipalities the right to regulate their own affairs, what kind of policy responsibilities does this article enable for municipalities?', 'answer': 'They administer programs authorized by the federal or state government and can develop and expand the economic infrastructure of their communities.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule 2 violation: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input. It shifts focus from identifying which article guarantees the right to regulate affairs to asking what policy responsibilities the article enables, and it presumes prior context. Therefore it is not a self-contained rephrase of the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Southern_Europe.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which of those non-Romance languages are official languages in any Southern European countries?', 'question': 'Considering that Greek, Turkish, Bulgarian, Romani, Albanian, Aromanian and Vlach are non-Romance languages spoken in Southern Europe, which of them are official languages in any of the countries within the region?', 'answer': 'Albanian is spoken in Albania, Kosovo, Macedoonia, and parts of Greece. Maltese is a Semitic language that is the official language of Malta. The Hellenic languages or Greek language are widely spoken in Greece and in the Greek part of Cyprus.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer is incorrect: it introduces Maltese (not part of the specified non-Romance list) and does not accurately reflect which of the listed languages are official. From the given set (Greek, Turkish, Bulgarian, Romani, Albanian, Aromanian, Vlach): Greek is official in Greece (and Cyprus), Turkish is official in Turkey, Bulgarian is official in Bulgaria, Albanian is official in Albania (and Kosovo; and in parts of North Macedonia), while Romani, Aromanian, and Vlach are not official nationwide. Spelling error ('Macedoonia') also appears. Therefore the response does not meet the requirements.}

Validation failed for title: Southern_Europe.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is Albanian not an official language in Albania?', 'question': 'Given that Greek, Turkish, Bulgarian, Romani, Albanian, Aromanian and Vlach are non-Romance languages spoken in Southern Europe, and that you stated only Greek is an official language in a Southern European country, is Albanian not an official language in Albania?', 'answer': 'Albanian is spoken in Albania, Kosovo, Macedoonia, and parts of Greece.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question asks whether Albanian is not an official language in Albania. The provided Answer only states where Albanian is spoken and does not confirm its official status; in fact Albanian is an official language in Albania. It also misspells 'North Macedonia' and includes extra, irrelevant details. Therefore the response fails both the factual accuracy and alignment with the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Imperial_College_London.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about Henley Royal Regatta, any wins there?', 'question': 'Following the discussion about the Imperial College Boat Club, and whether it had any Olympic medalists associated with it (to which you stated you did not have the information), did the club have any wins at the Henley Royal Regatta?', 'answer': 'The club has been highly successful, with many wins at Henley Royal Regatta including most recently in 2013 with victory in The Prince Albert Challenge Cup event.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the 'rag_input'. It introduces prior-conversation context about Olympic medalists and a claim that information was lacking, which makes it rely on prior history rather than being self-contained. This violates the requirement that the Question be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. Additionally, the 'rag_input' itself is simple, and the Question should reflect that content without enabling dependence on previous dialogue.

Validation failed for title: Imperial_College_London.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is the boat club only for Imperial College students?', 'question': 'Given that the Imperial College Boat Club has won at the Henley Royal Regatta, is membership in the boat club restricted to Imperial College students?', 'answer': 'The club has been home to numerous National Squad oarsmen and women and is open to all rowers not just students of Imperial College London.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the 'rag_input'. It adds extraneous context about Henley Royal Regatta that was not present in the rag_input, making it dependent on prior conversation. A proper standalone rephrase would mirror the membership question without external references, e.g., "Is membership in the Imperial College Boat Club restricted to Imperial College students, or can non-students join?"

Validation failed for title: Imperial_College_London.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Does Imperial College have other sports clubs?', 'question': 'Besides the Imperial College Boat Club, does Imperial College have any other sports clubs?', 'answer': 'Yes, the Union also hosts sports-related clubs such as Imperial College Boat Club and Imperial College Gliding Club.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer incorrectly includes the Imperial College Boat Club as one of the 'other' clubs. Since the question asks for clubs besides the Boat Club, the answer should mention other clubs (e.g., Imperial College Gliding Club) without listing the Boat Club itself.

Validation failed for title: Christian.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which religious group has a higher birth rate?', 'question': 'Based on the provided document regarding Christian population projections, which religious group has a higher birth rate than Christians?', 'answer': 'Muslims have an average of 3.1 children per woman—the highest rate of all religious groups. Christians are second, with 2.7 children per woman.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input fails Rule 1: it is too generic and does not clearly build on the prior turn (it should reflect the specific Christians-birth-rate comparison). Question fails Rule 2: it is not fully standalone and references 'the provided document' (which is disallowed) and therefore cannot be understood without prior history. Additionally, Rag_input and Question should be self-contained contextually; neither meets that requirement in this instance. The Answer itself is factually aligned with the referenced content, but the overall entry violates the specified constraints.

Validation failed for title: Christian.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What other factors contribute to Christian population growth besides birth rate?', 'question': 'Considering the earlier discussion about Christian population growth and birth rates compared to Muslims, what other reasons are cited for the Christian population increase besides the number of children per woman?', 'answer': 'High birth rates and conversion were cited as the reason for the Christian population growths.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Question is not standalone (it references an 'earlier discussion'), and the answer is inconsistent with the rag_input by including birth rate as an additional factor rather than focusing only on other factors such as conversion.

Validation failed for title: Christian.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which continents show the most Christian growth?', 'question': 'Given our discussion on factors contributing to Christian population growth, specifically conversions, which continents are identified as experiencing the most growth in Christianity?', 'answer': 'Christianity is growing in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Muslim world, and Oceania.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule violations: (1) Rag_input is too generic and not clearly built on the prior turn; it should be contextually connected. (2) Question is not standalone: it references 'our discussion' and 'conversions' rather than being self-contained. (3) The answer is not accurate for continents: Latin America is a region, not a continent, and 'Muslim world' is not a continent; a correct answer would name continents such as Africa and Asia (and possibly Oceania). (4) The overall entry fails to adhere to the required standalone, context-aware formatting for Rag_input/Question.

Validation failed for title: Intellectual_property.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Is there any debate around what constitutes 'not obvious'?", 'question': "Given that one of the requirements for patenting an invention is that it's 'not obvious,' is there any disagreement or differing interpretations about what qualifies as 'not obvious'?", 'answer': 'N/A', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided Answer is not a correct ground-truth response to the standalone Question. The Question asks whether there is disagreement about what qualifies as 'not obvious' in patent law; a correct answer should indicate that there is debate and mention common interpretive factors (e.g., ordinary skill in the art, Graham factors). The current Answer is 'N/A' and does not address the question.

Validation failed for title: Intellectual_property.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What about the 'new' requirement? Is that as debated?", 'question': "Compared to the 'not obvious' requirement for patents, how much debate exists around the 'new' requirement?", 'answer': 'N/A', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer 'N/A' does not reflect the document's content. The ground-truth should indicate that the provided material does not discuss any debate around the 'new' requirement; thus, the answer should state that absence of discussion rather than 'N/A'.

Validation failed for title: Intellectual_property.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Can you give an example of something that wouldn't be considered a public disclosure?", 'question': "Based on the definition of 'new' for patenting purposes, what is an example of something that would NOT be considered a public disclosure, and therefore would not impact an invention's novelty?", 'answer': 'N/A', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided Answer is not the correct ground-truth answer to the standalone Question. The Question asks for an example of something that would NOT be considered a public disclosure (and thus would not affect novelty). A correct answer would describe private/internal use or confidential disclosures (e.g., internal testing, demonstrations under NDA) as not constituting a public disclosure.

Validation failed for title: Clothing.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any safety guidelines exceeded?', 'question': 'When the U.S. Government Accountability Office tested formaldehyde in clothing and found the highest levels in non-wrinkle shirts and pants, were any safety guidelines exceeded in those items?', 'answer': 'In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer asserts that 7 of 27 shirts exceeded 75 ppm and then says that 75 ppm is a safe limit. Since 'in excess of 75 ppm' indicates values above the safe threshold, safety guidelines were exceeded. The correct response should state that 7 shirts exceeded the 75 ppm limit, implying guidelines were surpassed.

Validation failed for title: Transistor.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does the function differ between an n-p-n and p-n-p transistor?', 'question': 'You described the function of the emitter, base, and collector in a BJT. How do these functions differ between an n-p-n and a p-n-p transistor?', 'answer': 'In an n–p–n transistor operating in the active region, the emitter–base junction is forward biased (electrons and holes recombine at the junction), and electrons are injected into the base region. Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and move away from the junction) base–collector junction and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer only explains the n-p-n transistor's operation and does not discuss the p-n-p transistor or provide a comparison of emitter, base, and collector functions as asked.

Validation failed for title: Transistor.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Why are n-p-n transistors generally faster?', 'question': 'You mentioned that n-p-n transistors are generally faster than p-n-p transistors. Why is this the case?', 'answer': 'Because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar n–p–n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p–n–p transistor.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it relies on prior context ('You mentioned...') and is thus not a self-contained rephrase of the RAG_input. It should be a self-contained restatement of the original question without referencing past turns.

Validation failed for title: Internet_service_provider.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What are the differences between those that offer broader internet access and those that don't?", 'question': 'What are the differences between mailbox providers that offer broader internet access and those that focus solely on email hosting?', 'answer': 'Many mailbox providers are also access providers, while others are not (e.g., Yahoo! Mail, Outlook.com, Gmail, AOL Mail, Po box).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not identical to the 'rag_input' as required for the first turn. The first-turn rule requires exact identity between rag_input and Question, but here the Question adds extra context ('mailbox providers' and 'focus solely on email hosting') and is not a verbatim copy of rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Internet_service_provider.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about Wireless ISPs?', 'question': 'How do mailbox providers and virtual ISPs compare to Wireless ISPs (WISPs)?', 'answer': 'A wireless Internet service provider (WISP) is an Internet service provider with a network based on wireless networking. Technology may include commonplace Wi-Fi wireless mesh networking, or proprietary equipment designed to operate over open 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 4.9, 5.2, 5.4, 5.7, and 5.8 GHz bands or licensed frequencies such as 2.5 GHz (EBS/BRS), 3.65 GHz (NN) and in the UHF band (including the MMDS frequency band) and LMDS.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Question is not a faithful standalone rephrase of the rag_input; it adds scope (mailbox providers and virtual ISPs) and asks for a comparison, but the rag_input was only 'What about Wireless ISPs?' and should be addressed as a standalone follow-up. Additionally, the Answer only defines WISPs and does not provide the requested comparative analysis between mailbox providers/VISPs and Wireless ISPs (WISPs). A correct response should present a clear comparison across the three concepts.

Validation failed for title: Internet_service_provider.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are some of the regulatory requirements for WISPs?', 'question': 'Considering our discussion about the differences between mailbox providers, virtual ISPs, and wireless ISPs, what are some of the regulatory requirements specific to wireless ISPs?', 'answer': 'May need licenses for certain frequencies (e.g., 900 MHz, 5.8 GHz)', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references prior discussion rather than being a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input. The Answer is also incomplete and potentially inaccurate: regulatory requirements for WISPs include more than merely licensing certain frequencies, and the licensing status of bands like 900 MHz and 5.8 GHz varies by country (5.8 GHz is often unlicensed in the US). A complete answer should note multiple regulatory aspects (e.g., spectrum licensing where applicable, operator registrations, network equipment compliance, privacy/CALEA considerations, E911 for VoIP, etc.) and present a clear, country-specific scope.

Validation failed for title: Gregorian_calendar.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Okay, I see the correction. So the year only changes if the original year started on a different date than January 1st, right?', 'question': 'Explain Old Style and New Style dating in the context of the Gregorian calendar. Explain dual dating and give an example. Explain that the original example was incorrect and provide a correct example. Then explain that the year only changes in dual dating if the original year started on a different date than January 1st.', 'answer': 'Dual dating uses two consecutive years because of differences in the starting date of the year...Old Style and New Style (N.S.) indicate either whether the start of the Julian year has been adjusted to start on 1 January (N.S.) even though documents written at the time use a different start of year (O.S.), or whether a date conforms to the Julian calendar (O.S.) rather than the Gregorian (N.S.).', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The answer did not explicitly state that the original example was incorrect and did not provide a corrected dual-dating example as requested. It only gave a general explanation of Old Style/New Style without addressing the specific correction or supplying a concrete example.

Validation failed for title: Canon_law.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What is the main difference between canon law in the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion?', 'question': 'You mentioned canon law governs both the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion. What is the main difference between canon law in these two?', 'answer': 'In the Catholic Church, canon law is a fully developed legal system with its own courts and legal procedures, while in the Anglican Communion, it consists of shared principles across provinces, with each church maintaining its own legal system.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references a prior statement ('You mentioned canon law governs both the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion') rather than being a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input. A valid Question should be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input without referencing prior turns.

Validation failed for title: Canon_law.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, if Anglican canon law isn't really 'law' in the same way, what purpose does it serve?", 'question': "The Anglican Communion's canon law differs significantly from Catholic canon law in terms of legal authority and enforcement. If Anglican canon law is less about legally binding rules, what is its primary function or purpose within the Anglican Communion?", 'answer': 'The shared principles of canon law serve a unifying and pastoral role, emphasizing unity and mutual understanding rather than legal enforcement. The focus is on spiritual and communal harmony, not legal compliance.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrase of the rag_input. It adds comparative context about differences with Catholic canon law and mentions the Anglican Communion in a way that introduces new content not present in the original rag_input. A valid Question should be a self-contained rephrasing of the rag_input's query without external context or references.

Validation failed for title: Canon_law.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned that Anglican canon law helps maintain a common identity. How does it do that specifically?', 'question': 'In what specific ways does Anglican canon law contribute to maintaining a shared sense of identity among the various churches within the Anglican Communion?', 'answer': 'These shared principles — often referred to in documents like the *Canons of the Anglican Communion* — help maintain common identity and mutual recognition across diverse national contexts.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The rag_input asks for specific ways Anglican canon law contributes to a shared identity. The provided Answer is generic and does not enumerate concrete mechanisms (e.g., governance structures, appointment processes, shared disciplinary norms, dispute resolution, property/financial governance, liturgical guidance) that would concretely explain how identity is maintained.

Validation failed for title: Canon_law.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned the Book of Common Prayer. Is that actually part of Anglican canon law, or is it something different?', 'question': 'Is the Book of Common Prayer considered an integral part of Anglican canon law, or does it function as a separate entity?', 'answer': 'No.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The answer is incomplete. It should clearly state that the Book of Common Prayer is not part of Anglican canon law and describe its role as a liturgical/text resource for worship and church practice, rather than a legal code.

Validation failed for title: Liberia.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was that agricultural growth driven by local farmers or foreign investment?', 'question': 'You mentioned that agriculture helped offset some of the negative impacts of the global financial crisis in Liberia. Was that agricultural growth primarily driven by local farmers or by foreign investment?', 'answer': 'A strengthening agricultural sector led by rubber and timber exports increased growth to 5.1% in 2010 and an expected 7.3% in 2011. Following the inauguration of the Sirleaf administration in 2006, Liberia signed several multibillion-dollar concession agreements in the iron ore and palm oil industries with numerous multinational corporations, including BHP Billiton, ArcelorMittal, and Sime Darby.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone: it references prior discussion by saying 'You mentioned...' and relies on history. It should be a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input without referencing previous turns.

Validation failed for title: Liberia.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did that reliance on local farmers continue after the global financial crisis?', 'question': "Given that Liberia's agricultural sector relied heavily on local farmers to drive growth during the global financial crisis, did that reliance on local farmers continue after the global financial crisis?", 'answer': 'Following the inauguration of the Sirleaf administration in 2006, Liberia signed several multibillion-dollar concession agreements in the iron ore and palm oil industries with numerous multinational corporations, including BHP Billiton, ArcelorMittal, and Sime Darby. Especially palm oil companies like Sime Darby (Malaysia) and Golden Veroleum (USA) are being accused by critics of the destruction of livelihoods and the displacement of local communities, enabled through government concessions.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not directly address whether reliance on local farmers continued after the global financial crisis. It instead discusses concession agreements and foreign investment, which is not a standalone factual reply to the question about local farmers' continued role.

Validation failed for title: Post-punk.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were ABC, Adam and the Ants or Bow Wow Wow also part of this?', 'question': "Considering the previous discussion about groups embodying the shift toward 'overground brightness,' specifically in the context of Paul Morley's influence, were ABC, Adam and the Ants, or Bow Wow Wow also considered part of this same movement?", 'answer': 'Yes', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references 'the previous discussion' and 'same movement' (and Paul Morley’s influence), which rely on prior turns. It should be a self-contained rephrase of the RAG_input without requiring the history. Additionally, while the content is related, the standalone requirement is not met.

Validation failed for title: Heresy.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were the Boston martyrs accused of those things?', 'question': 'Considering the discussion about heresy, blasphemy, and apostasy, and historical figures accused of them, were the Boston martyrs also accused of heresy, blasphemy, and apostasy?', 'answer': 'The colony leaders perceived the teachings and practices of the rival Quaker sect as heretical, even to the point where laws were passed and executions were performed with the aim of ridding their colony of such perceived "heresies".', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer only discusses 'heresy' and does not address 'blasphemy' or 'apostasy,' which were included in the Question. The response fails to fully respond to the prompt asking about all three offenses.

Validation failed for title: Samoa.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What kind of government did they have at independence?', 'question': 'Given that Samoa gained independence in 1962 and celebrates it on June 1st, what form of government did Samoa establish upon achieving independence?', 'answer': "Two other paramount chiefs at the time of independence were appointed joint heads of state for life. Tupua Tamasese Mea'ole died in 1963, leaving Malietoa Tanumafili II sole head of state until his death on 11 May 2007, upon which Samoa changed from a constitutional monarchy to a parliamentary republic de facto.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer contains factual inaccuracies: (1) It states 'Two other paramount chiefs' at independence, but Samoa had two joint heads of state (Tupua Tamasese Mea'ole and Malietoa Tanumafili II); Mea'ole died in 1963, leaving Tanumafili II as head of state until 2007. (2) It claims Samoa changed from a constitutional monarchy to a parliamentary republic de facto after 2007, which is incorrect—the country remains a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system; the change was not a shift to a republic.

Validation failed for title: Samoa.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who was the first prime minister?', 'question': "Considering the discussion about Samoa's government after achieving independence as a constitutional monarchy, who served as the first prime minister of Samoa?", 'answer': "Fiame Mata'afa Faumuina Mulinu’u II, one of the four highest-ranking paramount chiefs in the country, became Samoa's first Prime Minister.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is too generic and does not clearly build on the prior turn; the Question is not an exact repetition of rag_input as required for the first turn (it adds context and reframing, which violates the exact-match requirement).

Validation failed for title: Hunter-gatherer.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Okay, disregarding the provided text, can you list some current hunter-gatherer societies?', 'question': 'Ignoring the previous response limitation on specific texts, can you provide a list of some hunter-gatherer societies that exist today?', 'answer': 'The Hadza, San, and !Kung of Africa, or the Ainu of Japan are examples of current hunter-gatherer societies.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer incorrectly includes the Ainu of Japan as a current hunter-gatherer society. While the Hadza, San, and !Kung are recognized contemporary hunter-gatherers, the Ainu are not generally classified as such today.

Validation failed for title: Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did the classification of interracial persons change over time in the census?', 'question': "Following the federal government's collection of data on ethnic groups for enforcing civil rights and ensuring equitable access to public services, how did the classification of interracial persons specifically change over time in the United States census?", 'answer': 'In 1850, the census questionnaire for free inhabitants had a column to be left blank if a person was white, marked "B" if black, and "M" if mulatto. In later years, enumerators were instructed to no longer use the "Mulatto" classification. A person with both white and black ancestry was to be recorded as "Negro", no matter the fraction of that lineage. A person of mixed black and American Indian ancestry was also to be recorded as "Neg" unless considered to be "predominantly" American Indian. A person with White and American Indian ancestry was recorded as an Indian, unless their American Indian ancestry was small and they were accepted as white. In all situations with White and another race, they were reported as that other race. In 2000, respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not identical to rag_input; it adds extra framing and changes wording. The required format specifies that Question must be exactly the same as rag_input for the first turn.

Validation failed for title: Asthma.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned salbutamol. How does that help with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction?', 'question': 'Given that exercise can trigger bronchoconstriction in some individuals with asthma, how does a short-acting beta-2 agonist like salbutamol help in managing or preventing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction?', 'answer': 'Inhaled beta2-agonists do not appear to improve athletic performance among those without asthma however oral doses may improve endurance and strength.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided answer does not accurately or completely address how salbutamol helps with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. It focuses on general athletic performance rather than the mechanism and purpose of salbutamol for EIB (bronchodilation to prevent bronchoconstriction during exercise, typically with inhaled forms prior to exertion). It also makes an unsubstantiated claim about oral beta-2 agonists potentially improving endurance, which is not standard or reliable guidance for EIB management.

Validation failed for title: Asthma.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, if someone's asthma is well-controlled with an inhaled corticosteroid, do they still need to use salbutamol before exercise?", 'question': "Given that inhaled corticosteroids and salbutamol can both help manage asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, if an individual's asthma is already well-controlled with a regular inhaled corticosteroid, is it still necessary for them to use salbutamol before exercising?", 'answer': 'Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks. The most common triggers include allergens, smoke (tobacco and other), air pollution, non selective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address whether salbutamol is still needed before exercise for someone whose asthma is well-controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid. Instead, it discusses triggers, which is not directly relevant to the user's question about pre-exercise salbutamol usage.

Validation failed for title: Digestion.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What activates trypsinogen?', 'question': 'Following up on the enzymes involved in breaking down proteins, the response mentioned that trypsin and chymotrypsin are secreted as inactive precursors. What activates trypsinogen?', 'answer': 'Enterokinase activates trypsinogen in the duodenum.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it references prior discussion and includes extra context not derivable from the RAG_input alone. A standalone rephrase of the rag_input should be something like: 'Which enzyme activates trypsinogen, and where does this activation occur?'

Validation failed for title: Digestion.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Where does carboxypeptidase work?', 'question': 'Following the discussion on how trypsin activates other enzymes like carboxypeptidase, where does carboxypeptidase perform its function in the digestive system?', 'answer': 'Carboxypeptidase cleaves amino acids from the C-terminal end of peptides in the small intestine.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrase of the rag_input; it references prior discussion and is not self-contained. It should be understandable without history and not mention prior conversations.

Validation failed for title: Digestion.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "How does that compare to pepsin's function?", 'question': 'How does the function of carboxypeptidase in breaking down peptides compare to the function of pepsin in protein digestion?', 'answer': 'Pepsin breaks down proteins into smaller polypeptides in the stomach, while carboxypeptidase breaks down peptides into individual amino acids in the small intestine.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to 'rag_input'; it should be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input that is self-contained and not identical.

Validation failed for title: Glacier.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What is a bergschrund, and how does it relate to these marginal crevasses?', 'question': 'Given that transverse, longitudinal and marginal crevasses are formed by different stresses on a glacier, what is a bergschrund, and how does it relate to these marginal crevasses which form due to friction with valley walls?', 'answer': "Moving glacier ice can sometimes separate from stagnant ice above, forming a bergschrund. Bergschrunds resemble crevasses but are singular features at a glacier's margins.", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The answer only states that bergschrund is a marginal feature and resembles crevasses, but it does not compare or contrast bergschrund with marginal crevasses formed by valley-wall friction. A bergschrund is a crevasse-like gap at the head of a glacier where moving ice separates from stagnant ice, and it is not primarily caused by friction with valley walls; marginal crevasses along valley margins form due to reduced speed from friction with the valley walls. The answer should explicitly distinguish these concepts.

Validation failed for title: United_Nations_Population_Fund.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What regions does it work in?', 'question': 'Considering our discussion about UNFPA and its general work related to the Sustainable Development Goals, what geographic regions does it operate in?', 'answer': 'The UNFPA supports programs in more than 150 countries, territories and areas spread across four geographic regions: Arab States and Europe, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input; it adds external context about UNFPA's work with the Sustainable Development Goals, which makes it not self-contained as required.

Validation failed for title: Literature.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were these works of Homer and Hesiod prose or poetry?', 'question': 'The system stated that some of the earliest examples of literature from ancient Greece are the epics of Homer (The Iliad and The Odyssey) and the works of Hesiod (Works and Days and Theogony). Were these works of Homer and Hesiod prose or poetry?', 'answer': 'Poetry', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone: it references a prior system statement and earlier context rather than being a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input. It should paraphrase the RAG_input without referring to documents or prior outputs.

Validation failed for title: Literature.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Can you give an example of a literary device used in Homer's Iliad?", 'question': 'The Iliad is an early example of Greek literature written in dactylic hexameter. Can you give an example of a literary device used in the Iliad?', 'answer': 'Simile, metaphor, epithet', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is not identical to the 'rag_input'. The first turn requires the Question to be exactly the rag_input content; the provided Question adds extra framing about dactylic hexameter and thus does not match.

Validation failed for title: Literature.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is anaphora also used in the Odyssey?', 'question': "Anaphora is a literary device used in Homer's Iliad. Is anaphora also used in Homer's Odyssey?", 'answer': 'Yes', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is not a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input; it references Iliad (prior context) and thus relies on history. The Question should be a self-contained rewording of the rag_input that does not mention other works or prior statements.

Validation failed for title: Literature.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any other literary devices commonly found in both the Iliad and the Odyssey?', 'question': 'Are there literary devices, besides anaphora, that are commonly found in both the Iliad and the Odyssey?', 'answer': 'Simile, metaphor, epithet', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrase of the 'rag_input'. It adds a constraint ('besides anaphora') that is not present in the rag_input, and thus it narrows the scope in a way that deviates from a faithful rephrase. The rag_input asks about common literary devices in both works in general, whereas the 'Question' implies excluding one device (anaphora) and references it, which breaks the required one-to-one paraphrase rule.

Validation failed for title: Architecture.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What ultimately led to its widespread acceptance?', 'question': 'Considering the initial resistance to Bauhaus ideas, what factors contributed to its eventual widespread acceptance?', 'answer': 'As the world experienced the devastation of two world wars, the rise of industrialization, and growing demand for', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Answer' is incomplete/truncated and does not provide a complete, factual statement addressing the question. It ends mid-sentence ('and growing demand for'), which fails the requirement that the Answer be a complete, correct response to the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Warsaw_Pact.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What specific position did Ismay hold at the time?', 'question': "Given that General Hastings Ismay expressed his opinion on the USSR's request to join NATO, what specific position did he hold at that time that influenced his view?", 'answer': 'The document identifies him as a supporter of NATO expansion.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer fails to identify Ismay's specific position at the time (Secretary General of NATO). The question asks for his official role, but the provided answer only notes his stance on NATO expansion and does not mention his title.

Validation failed for title: Warsaw_Pact.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did anyone else share his sentiment about the USSR joining?', 'question': 'Given that General Hastings Ismay opposed the USSR joining NATO, and he was the first Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, did anyone else share his sentiment about the USSR joining NATO around that time?', 'answer': 'The provided text mentions that the request to join NATO was rejected by the UK, US, and French governments shortly after.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address whether anyone else shared Ismay's sentiment about the USSR joining NATO. It instead states that the NATO membership requests were rejected by UK/US/France, which is a different fact and does not answer the Question.

Validation failed for title: National_Archives_and_Records_Administration.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "How does the material at WNRC eventually become part of NARA's official holdings?", 'question': "Following the information that the Washington National Records Center (WNRC) stores federal records that are still under the control of the creating agency, how do these records eventually become part of the National Archives and Records Administration's (NARA) official holdings?", 'answer': 'In accordance with federal records schedules, documents at WNRC are transferred to the legal custody of the National Archives after a certain point, which usually involves a relocation of the records to College Park.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not self-contained; it relies on prior context by starting with 'Following the information that...' and does not stand alone as a rephrasing of the rag_input. It should be a standalone restatement without referencing previous turns.

Validation failed for title: National_Archives_and_Records_Administration.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Who decides if a record has limited historical value and won't be transferred?", 'question': 'Given that federal records stored at the Washington National Records Center (WNRC) may not be transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) if they are determined to be of limited historical value, what entity or individual is responsible for making that determination?', 'answer': "I am sorry, but the documents provided do not specify who makes the determination about a record's historical value.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide the entity or individual responsible for making the determination. It simply states that the documents do not specify who makes the determination, which does not give a ground-truth answer to the standalone question.

Validation failed for title: National_Archives_and_Records_Administration.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What recourse does the public have if they disagree with a decision not to transfer a record?', 'question': "Considering that both the originating federal agency and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) assess the historical value of records stored at the Washington National Records Center (WNRC) to determine if they should be transferred to NARA's permanent collection, what options are available to the public if they believe a record with historical value is wrongly being withheld from transfer?", 'answer': 'I am sorry, but the provided document does not provide information about public recourse if they disagree with a decision not to transfer a record.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The previous answer asserts broad exceptions and a multi-step determination process for transfer that are not documented in the provided material. The only explicit detail in the source is that temporary records at WNRC may be retained for a fee or destroyed after their retention periods; no official exceptions or decision-makers are specified in the given document.

Validation failed for title: Iranian_languages.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'And the Nuristani languages, where do they fit in?', 'question': 'Given that Iranian and Indo-Aryan languages descend from Proto-Indo-Iranian, are there any other languages or language families related to Proto-Indo-Iranian besides Iranian and Indo-Aryan, such as the Nuristani languages, and where do they fit in the family tree?', 'answer': 'Proto-Iranian descends from Proto-Indo-Iranian together with Proto-Indo-Aryan and the Nuristani languages.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not correctly address the Question. The Question asks for the additional language family beyond Iranian and Indo-Aryan that descends from Proto-Indo-Iranian (i.e., Nuristani). The Answer improperly states that Proto-Iranian descends from Proto-Indo-Iranian together with Proto-Indo-Aryan and the Nuristani languages, which incorrectly includes Indo-Aryan as an additional branch and misstates the genealogical direction. The correct answer should identify Nuristani languages as the extra branch stemming from Proto-Indo-Iranian, distinct from Iranian and Indo-Aryan.

Validation failed for title: Great_Plains.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "But wouldn't a strong social network attract more residents, which in turn would help the town survive?", 'question': "Given the discussion about the factors influencing the survival of towns in Kansas, including transportation and social gatherings, wouldn't a strong social network, facilitated by organizations like the Grange and social gatherings, attract more residents to a town, which in turn would contribute to the town's survival?", 'answer': 'The railroads opened up the Great Plains for settlement, for now it was possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the East, and Europe. Homestead land was free for American settlers. Railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the Question. The Question asks whether a strong social network (e.g., Grange, social gatherings) would attract more residents and contribute to town survival. The Answer instead reiterates railroad/immigration factors and does not discuss the potential impact of social networks on survival, making it not aligned with the asked query. The appropriate answer should note that, according to the text, transportation access was the primary determinant, while social life existed but was not described as a direct survival factor.

Validation failed for title: Sony_Music_Entertainment.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, what happened to the CBS name after the acquisition?', 'question': 'After Sony acquired CBS Records in 1987, what happened to the rights to the CBS name for music recordings?', 'answer': 'CBS Inc., now CBS Corporation, retained the rights to the CBS name for music recordings but granted Sony a temporary license to use the CBS name.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' must be exactly identical to the 'rag_input' for the first turn. rag_input: 'So, what happened to the CBS name after the acquisition?'. The provided Question: 'After Sony acquired CBS Records in 1987, what happened to the rights to the CBS name for music recordings?' is not identical, so it fails the required format. ( Other fields are acceptable, but this primary rule is violated. )

Validation failed for title: Sony_Music_Entertainment.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about Japan? Did they also use the Columbia label?', 'question': 'Following the acquisition of CBS Records by Sony and the subsequent renaming to Sony Music Entertainment, did Sony use the Columbia label in Japan as they did in other regions?', 'answer': 'Japan is the only country where Sony does not have rights to the Columbia name as it is controlled by Nippon Columbia, an unrelated company. Thus, until this day, Sony Music Entertainment Japan does not use the Columbia trademark for Columbia label recordings from outside Japan which are issued in Japan.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' must be identical to the 'rag_input' for the first turn. The rag_input is 'What about Japan? Did they also use the Columbia label?', but the 'Question' provided is a longer, context-expanded version that is not an exact copy.

Validation failed for title: Sony_Music_Entertainment.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'When did Sony acquire the international rights to the Columbia name from EMI?', 'question': 'When did Sony acquire the international rights to the Columbia name from EMI?', 'answer': 'Sony acquired the international rights to the trademark from EMI in 1990.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule 2 violation: The 'Question' must be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input and not identical to it. In this input, the Question is identical to rag_input, which fails the requirement.

Validation failed for title: Aspirated_consonant.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are aspirated fricatives common?', 'question': 'Following the example of Choni Tibetan, which has four contrastive aspirated fricatives, are aspirated fricatives generally common in languages worldwide?', 'answer': 'No, aspirated fricatives are not common. While they exist in languages like Korean, some Tibeto-Burman languages, Oto-Manguean languages, and the Siouan language Ofo, they are not as widespread as aspirated stops and affricates.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input does not clearly build on the prior turn; it is a generic, standalone question. The requirement is that RAG_input be contextually connected to the previous discussion (e.g., referencing Choni Tibetan's four aspirated fricatives). The accompanying Question does introduce that context, but the Rag_input itself fails the contextual continuity rule.

Validation failed for title: Aspirated_consonant.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, are aspirated stops more commonly phonemic than aspirated fricatives?', 'question': 'Given the discussion about Korean and Choni Tibetan, is it generally true that aspirated stops are more commonly phonemic in languages than aspirated fricatives?', 'answer': 'While the document does not explicitly state this as a universal rule, it does imply that aspirated stops are more commonly phonemic. The document states that most aspirated obstruents are stops and affricates, and it also highlights that the primary contrast in Korean is between tenuis and aspirated stops and affricates, with fricatives showing less consistent phonemic contrast.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrase of the rag_input; it references a prior discussion about Korean and Choni Tibetan rather than restating the same query in a self-contained way. It relies on history and is not self-contained as required. This violates the 'Question' formatting rule. The rag_input itself is clear, but the mismatch in standalone rephrase is the failing point.

Validation failed for title: Infrared.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there specific wavelengths used in infrared reflectography, and how do they affect what materials are visible?', 'question': 'Based on the uses of infrared radiation, including in art conservations via infrared reflectography, are there specific wavelengths used in infrared reflectography, and how do they affect what materials are visible in the resulting images?', 'answer': "The document doesn't specify the exact wavelengths used in infrared reflectography, but it mentions that the technique is effective in revealing carbon black underdrawings. This suggests that the wavelengths used are those that are well-absorbed or reflected by carbon black, making it stand out against other materials in the painting.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references a document (e.g., 'The document doesn't specify...'), which violates the rule 'Never mention that a document was provided.' This makes the input invalid under Rule 1.

Validation failed for title: Infrared.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned UV reflectography; how does that differ from infrared reflectography, and what specific information does it provide that infrared might miss?', 'question': 'Considering that infrared reflectography is used to reveal underdrawings by detecting carbon and that the presence of carbon in the ground layer can complicate the interpretation, how does UV reflectography differ from infrared reflectography in art conservation, and what specific information can UV provide that infrared analysis might overlook?', 'answer': 'The document does not provide details on UV reflectography. Therefore, a comparative answer cannot be derived.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer relies on stating that a document was not provided, which violates the rule to never mention documents. It also fails to provide a substantive, self-contained comparative answer about UV vs. infrared reflectography.

Validation failed for title: Matter.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, massless particles aren't considered matter, even though they carry energy. Does that mean energy isn't matter?", 'question': 'Given that massless particles carrying energy are not considered matter, is it correct to infer that energy itself is not matter?', 'answer': "Before the 20th century, the term matter included ordinary matter composed of atoms and excluded other energy phenomena such as light or sound. This concept of matter may be generalized from atoms to include any objects having mass even when at rest, but this is ill-defined because an object's mass can arise from its (possibly massless) constituents' motion and interaction energies. Thus, matter does not have a universal definition, nor is it a fundamental concept in physics today.", 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer does not directly address the standalone Question about whether energy is matter; it provides a general historical/definitional discussion of matter and mass instead of a concise, correct answer to whether energy itself qualifies as matter.

Validation failed for title: Matter.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, the distinction is more about scale and how we observe things. But if we could perfectly measure everything, would the distinction disappear entirely?', 'question': 'If perfect measurement were possible, would the distinction between matter and energy completely disappear, given that it is currently maintained primarily due to differences in scale and observation?', 'answer': 'Matter does not have a universal definition, nor is it a fundamental concept in physics today. Matter is also used loosely as a general term for the substance that makes up all observable physical objects.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the standalone Question about whether the distinction between matter and energy would disappear with perfect measurement. It instead discusses the definitional ambiguity of 'matter,' which is not the requested topic, and does not provide a factual answer to the hypothetical scenario.

Validation failed for title: Matter.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, even though QGP is a phase of matter, it's more about the particles and their interactions than classical volume. Does this mean the 'particulate theory of matter' is still relevant in these extreme cases?", 'question': "Given that quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is considered a phase of matter primarily due to its constituent particles and their interactions rather than its classical volume, does this imply that the 'particulate theory of matter' remains relevant, even in such extreme phases of matter?", 'answer': 'The idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks, the so-called particulate theory of matter, was first put forward by the Greek philosophers Leucippus (~490 BC) and Democritus (~470–380 BC).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer does not address the standalone question about whether the particulate theory remains relevant for extreme phases like quark-gluon plasma. It only provides the historical origin of the particulate theory and does not discuss modern relevance or how QGP affects the concept.

Validation failed for title: Matter.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned that quantum field theory sees everything as arising from fields. Does this imply that the distinction between matter and non-matter energy is ultimately artificial?', 'question': 'Considering that quantum field theory posits that all phenomena, including matter and energy, arise from underlying fields, does this suggest that the distinction between matter and non-matter energy is fundamentally artificial, a construct of our limited perception rather than a true reflection of reality?', 'answer': 'However, not all particles with rest mass have a classical volume, since fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons (sometimes equated with matter) are considered "point particles" with no effective size or volume. Nevertheless, quarks and leptons together make up "ordinary matter", and their interactions contribute to the effective volume of the composite particles that make up ordinary matter.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the standalone Question about whether the distinction between matter and non-matter energy is artificial. It instead discusses particle volume, point-like particles, and the composition of ordinary matter, which is tangential and fails to directly evaluate the conceptual unification implied by quantum field theory.

Validation failed for title: Sanskrit.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about administrative or literary texts?', 'question': 'The document says sacred texts were preserved orally. Aside from sacred texts, does the document mention if the Siddhaṃ script was used for administrative or literary texts?', 'answer': 'When Sanskrit was written down, it was first used for texts of an administrative, literary or scientific nature.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not self-contained: it refers to 'the document' rather than being a standalone rephrasing, violating the requirement that the Question be understandable without history. Additionally, the Answer does not directly address whether Siddhaṃ was used for administrative or literary texts, making it irrelevant to the Question.

Validation failed for title: Sanskrit.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What scripts were used before Brahmi?', 'question': 'Considering the discussion of Sanskrit scripts, including Brahmi, what scripts, if any, were used before the Brahmi script to write Sanskrit or any other language in the Indian subcontinent according to the text?', 'answer': 'Roughly contemporary with the Brahmi, Kharosthi was used in the northwest of the subcontinent.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input: it adds extra context and explicitly references 'according to the text,' which violates the requirement to be self-contained and not refer to any document. It also is not identical to the rag_input, which was the expected format for the first turn.

Validation failed for title: Baptists.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What were the main reasons for the split between the General and Particular Baptists?', 'question': 'Based on the prior discussion about the origins and branches of the Baptist church, can you elaborate on the primary theological differences that led to the division between General and Particular Baptists?', 'answer': "The General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it references 'the prior discussion' and relies on earlier context. It should be a self-contained rephrase of the RAG_input without referring to prior turns.

Validation failed for title: Baptists.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any specific individuals who exemplified these differences in missionary approach?', 'question': 'Considering the differing approaches to missionary work between General and Particular Baptists, are there any notable historical figures whose actions or philosophies clearly illustrate these distinctions?', 'answer': 'Not applicable. The provided text does not mention specific individuals that exemplify the differences in missionary approach between General and Particular Baptists.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references prior discussion by using 'these differences' instead of being a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input. It should be a self-contained paraphrase of the rag_input. Additionally, the Answer should directly address the standalone Question; 'Not applicable' does not provide a factual answer.

Validation failed for title: Geography_of_the_United_States.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'You mentioned hurricane risk is a major difference. Are there any other natural disaster risks that are more prominent in the rest of the South compared to southern Florida?', 'question': 'Given the previous discussion about climate differences between Southern Florida and the rest of the Southern United States, and noting the increased hurricane risk in Southern Florida, are there any other natural disaster risks that are more prominent in the rest of the South compared to southern Florida?', 'answer': 'While the provided document focuses on climate, it mentions that the Appalachian region and the Midwest (which overlaps with the South) experience the worst floods. So, potentially flooding.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not self-contained: it refers to 'previous discussion' rather than restating the RAG_input in a standalone form. The RAG_input should be rephrased into a standalone Question that does not rely on prior turns. Additionally, the Answer improperly cites a 'provided document' as justification, which violates the rule to avoid mentioning any document and to base the answer solely on the RAG_input / standalone Question.

Validation failed for title: Wayback_Machine.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was that growth rate consistent?', 'question': "Was the Wayback Machine's data growth rate of 100 terabytes per month in 2009 consistent over time?", 'answer': 'The growth rate reported in 2003 was 12 terabytes/month.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address whether the 2009 growth rate of 100 TB/month was consistent over time. It cites the 2003 growth rate (12 TB/month) instead, which does not answer the Question.

Validation failed for title: Symbiosis.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Give me an example of synnecrosis.', 'question': 'Given that synnecrosis is a rare and ultimately fatal symbiotic relationship for both organisms involved, can you provide an example of synnecrosis?', 'answer': 'An example of this is the relationship between some species of bees and victims of the bee sting. Species of bees who die after stinging their prey inflict pain on themselves (albeit to protect the hive) as well as on the victim.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not identical to rag_input. For the first turn, the Question must be exactly the same as the rag_input content.

Validation failed for title: Animal.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Does external digestion mean fungi can't be predators?", 'question': 'Given that animals and fungi digest food differently (animals internally, fungi externally), does the fact that fungi use external digestion preclude them from being predators?', 'answer': 'No, fungi can be parasitic, breaking down living organisms.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The answer asserts that fungi can be parasitic but does not acknowledge that some fungi are predatory or carnivorous (external digestion of prey). It does not directly address whether external digestion precludes predation and is therefore incomplete/incorrect.

Validation failed for title: Animal.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any animals that use external digestion like fungi?', 'question': 'Given our discussion about digestion, specifically the differences between internal (animals) and external (fungi) digestion, are there any animals that employ external digestion, similar to fungi?', 'answer': 'No animals use external digestion.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not fully standalone because it references prior discussion ('our discussion'), violating the requirement that the Question be self-contained. Additionally, the Answer is factually incorrect: there are animals that perform external digestion (e.g., plant-parasitic nematodes and some other parasites/pathogens secrete digestive enzymes into a host’s tissue and absorb nutrients, effectively digesting externally).

Validation failed for title: Nutrition.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does diet affect these phyla?', 'question': 'How does diet affect the abundance and function of the four dominant phyla of gut flora in humans (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria)?', 'answer': 'The bacteria in the gut are also affected by food that is consumed.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer is too vague and does not address how diet alters the abundance and function of the four dominant phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria). It should provide a specific, stand-alone explanation relevant to the question.

Validation failed for title: Nutrition.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are some examples of prebiotics?', 'question': 'Following our discussion on the influence of diet on gut flora, specifically, what are some examples of prebiotics that benefit Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria?', 'answer': 'I am sorry, but the document mentions probiotics as a dietary supplement but not prebiotics.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide any examples of prebiotics and incorrectly claims the document only mentions probiotics; it fails to address the question content with factual, stand-alone examples.

Validation failed for title: Melbourne.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Tell me more about the music scene.', 'question': 'Tell me more about the music scene in Melbourne, given that you mentioned it as an international cultural center.', 'answer': 'Melbourne is an international cultural centre, with cultural endeavours spanning major events and festivals, drama, musicals, comedy, music, art, architecture, literature, film and television.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not fully standalone; it relies on prior context by referencing the claim that Melbourne is an international cultural centre. A standalone question should be understandable without any history or previous statements.

Validation failed for title: Melbourne.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which city has the strongest indie scene?', 'question': 'Out of Melbourne, New York City, Mexico City, and Houston, which city is known for having the most prominent or influential indie music scene?', 'answer': "I am sorry, but the document does not contain information to definitively determine which of the listed cities has the 'strongest' indie scene.", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: RAG_input does not clearly build on the prior turn; it is a standalone, generic prompt rather than contextually connected to the Melbourne-focused discussion in the history. This violates the requirement that RAG_input be contextually connected to the prior turn. The other fields (Question, Type, Answer) are aligned with the format, but the core contextual continuity is missing.

Validation failed for title: Melbourne.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are any of those venues particularly good for seeing up-and-coming bands?', 'question': 'Considering the Melbourne venues mentioned previously as supporters of indie music, which ones are especially known for showcasing up-and-coming or newly formed bands?', 'answer': 'I am sorry, but the document does not contain information to determine which of the listed venues are particularly known for showcasing up-and-coming bands.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not fully standalone as it references 'the Melbourne venues mentioned previously' instead of being understandable on its own. Additionally, the Answer is incorrect because the provided history does contain information about venues that support indie music, so claiming there is no information available is not accurate.

Validation failed for title: Melbourne.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is the Corner Hotel still volunteer-run?', 'question': 'Given that the Corner Hotel in Melbourne was described as having a strong DIY ethic and being volunteer-run, is it still operated primarily by volunteers today?', 'answer': 'I am sorry, but the document does not contain information about whether The Corner Hotel is still volunteer-run today.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it relies on prior description of the Corner Hotel's DIY ethos and volunteer-run status. Additionally, the Answer is not accurate given the history states that the venue is owned and run by local volunteers, providing information about its volunteer operation.

Validation failed for title: East_India_Company.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What were the main trading posts of the East India Company at the time?', 'question': "Considering the East India Company's factories were closed as retribution, what were the main trading posts for the company around the time of Every's attack in 1695?", 'answer': 'The company established trading posts in Surat (1619), Madras (1639), Bombay (1668), and Calcutta (1690).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not identical to the rag_input. It adds extraneous context about Every's attack in 1695, making it not a standalone rephrasing of the original question. The rules require the Question to be exactly the same as the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: List_of_numbered_streets_in_Manhattan.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Where is Plaza Lafayette?', 'question': 'You mentioned that the western end of 181st Street is known as Plaza Lafayette. Can you tell me where Plaza Lafayette is specifically located?', 'answer': 'The document states that 181st Street runs from the Washington Bridge in the east to the Henry Hudson Parkway in the west, near the George Washington Bridge and the Hudson River. The western end is called Plaza Lafayette. Therefore, Plaza Lafayette is located at the western end of 181st Street, near the Henry Hudson Parkway, the George Washington Bridge, and the Hudson River.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it references a previous statement ('You mentioned...') and thus fails the standalone requirement. It should be a self-contained rephrasing of the rag_input that does not rely on prior dialogue or refer to prior mentions. Additionally, it should not be identical to the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: List_of_numbered_streets_in_Manhattan.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any other exceptions to the one-way rule in Manhattan mentioned?', 'question': 'Besides 181st Street, which you described as an exception, does the provided text mention any other numbered streets in Manhattan that deviate from the general one-way traffic pattern where even-numbered streets are eastbound and odd-numbered streets are westbound?', 'answer': 'Yes, the document mentions that several exceptions reverse the even/odd one-way rule. It also specifically mentions that most wider streets carry two-way traffic, as do a few of the narrow ones.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references prior discussion about 181st Street and a previous answer. It should be a self-contained rephrasing of the rag_input without referring to prior turns or specific prior mentions.

Validation failed for title: Eritrea.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Is there a penalty if a group doesn't register?", 'question': "In Eritrea, religious groups other than the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Sunni Islam, the Eritrean Catholic Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church must submit personal information on their membership to register with the government. Is there a penalty if a group doesn't register?", 'answer': 'All other faiths and denominations are required to undergo a registration process.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address whether a penalty exists. The RAG_input asks about penalties for non-registration, but the Answer only states that non-recognized groups must register and does not mention penalties.

Validation failed for title: Eritrea.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is this registration requirement new?', 'question': 'In Eritrea, religious groups other than the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Sunni Islam, the Eritrean Catholic Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church must submit personal information on their membership to register with the government, and failing to do so means they are not allowed to worship. Is this registration requirement new?', 'answer': 'Since May 2002, the government of Eritrea has officially recognized the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church (Oriental Orthodox), Sunni Islam, the Eritrean Catholic Church (a Metropolitanate sui juris) and the Evangelical Lutheran church. All other faiths and denominations are required to undergo a registration process.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer does not address whether the registration requirement is new. It only states which groups are recognized and that all other faiths must register, but provides no information about when the registration requirement started or whether it is new.

Validation failed for title: Eritrea.md
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was that always the case?', 'question': 'In Eritrea, religious groups other than the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Sunni Islam, the Eritrean Catholic Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church must submit personal information on their membership to register with the government, and failing to do so means they are not allowed to worship. The exact start date of this registration requirement is unknown. Was that always the case, or were there different rules previously?', 'answer': 'Since May 2002, the government of Eritrea has officially recognized the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church (Oriental Orthodox), Sunni Islam, the Eritrean Catholic Church (a Metropolitanate sui juris) and the Evangelical Lutheran church. All other faiths and denominations are required to undergo a registration process.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer states a specific start date (May 2002) for the registration requirement, but the prior context indicates the exact start date is unknown; the response should reflect uncertainty or discuss historical rules rather than asserting a date.
