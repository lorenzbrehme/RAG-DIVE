In a 1931 letter to S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi, Freud playfully warned against the progression of physical intimacy in therapeutic contexts, cautioning that starting with kissing could lead to more extensive forms of \"pawing\" or petting, which, while not leading to procreation (\"doesn't make a baby\"), could escalate further. This humorous admonition reflects an awareness of how intimate behaviors like kissing and petting (\"making out\") could extend into a broader repertoire of physical affection. Freud's commentary thus illustrates early recognition of \"making out\" not just as casual kissing but as part of a spectrum of sexual or semi-sexual behaviors, informing how such interactions were culturally and psychologically perceived during the early 20th century.",

Nomadic Herding: People migrate with their animals in search of fodder. Animals raised include cattle, sheep, goats, camels, yaks, llamas, and reindeer depending on the region.\n\n4. Intensive Subsistence Farming: Farmers cultivate small plots of land using simple tools and labor intensively, often growing multiple crops annually. They use methods like terraces, manure, irrigation, and animal waste as fertilizer to enhance productivity.

After a decade or more, the farmer may return to the same piece of land. This cycle allows the land to recover, making the practice sustainable when population pressures are low.

While the fire triangle identifies three essential elements for fire ignition and sustenance\u2014heat, fuel, and an oxidizing agent (usually oxygen)\u2014the fire tetrahedron adds the chemical chain reaction as the fourth element.\n\nOnce a fire has started, this chemical chain reaction sustains the fire and allows it to continue until at least one of the four elements is removed or blocked. In other words, the fire tetrahedron illustrates that a fire requires not only heat, fuel, and oxygen but also a self-sustaining chemical reaction to keep burning.\n\nRemoving any one of these four elements\u2014the heat, fuel, oxidizer, or the chemical chain reaction\u2014will extinguish the fire. The concept is important in fire fighting because it explains additional methods of fire suppression. For example, halon extinguishers work by interrupting the chemical chain reaction, while foam denies oxygen and water lowers the temperature (heat). This model gives a more complete understanding of fire behavior and extinguishing techniques beyond the traditional fire triangle.",

Hydrocarbon or Oil Fires: Adding water to fires involving oil or hydrocarbons can cause the oil to spread since oil and water do not mix, thereby spreading the fire even further.\n\n3. Fires with Live Electricity Present: Water conducts electricity, so using water on electrical fires can present an electrocution hazard and potentially worsen the situation.\n\nTherefore, in these cases, water is not an appropriate extinguishing agent and alternative methods or agents should be used.",

They are known to play fetch, open doors, and are sensitive to human emotions. Russian Blues enjoy playing with various toys and develop loyal bonds with their loved ones and other family pets. They are generally considered a quiet breed but exceptions exist. They are clean, usually reserved around strangers unless raised in an active household. Many Russian Blues can be trained to do tricks. They are also fierce hunters and have exceptional athleticism, rivaling Abyssinians for their ability to leap and climb. Despite being slow to mature, they can remain playful well into adulthood and have an excellent memory, remembering hiding places of favorite toys and favorite visitors.

Other examples include Kansas suing Colorado to enjoin the diversion of water from an interstate stream, and Georgia suing the Tennessee Copper Company to enjoin fumes from a copper plant that were injuring land in Georgia counties.

For example, states have sued other states or companies to stop pollution, such as Missouri v. Illinois where Missouri sued Illinois over sewage discharge into the Mississippi River.

Cases Involving Incapacitated or Disabled Individuals: The state may act under parens patriae to protect adults who are incapacitated, mentally impaired, or disabled and unable to care for themselves. Courts may appoint guardians ad litem or take other protective actions on their behalf.\n\n3. Antitrust Litigation: Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 (15 USC 15c), state attorneys general may bring parens patriae suits on behalf of injured citizens in cases of antitrust violations. For example, in Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., the state sued for injunctive relief related to price fixing.\n\n4. Legal Oversight of Custody and Family Law: Courts may enforce or review agreements related to parental responsibility and custody to ensure that decisions are in the best interests of children, even overriding agreements between parents if necessary.\n\nThese examples illustrate that parens patriae is used broadly to protect the welfare of vulnerable individuals and the state's interests beyond just environmental issues.",

This demonstrates a limitation on the remedies available under parens patriae suits.\n\nMoreover, in Louisiana v.

Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors, Inc., state attorneys general were allowed to sue as parens patriae on behalf of natural-person residents to recover damages for overcharges caused by price-fixing. This indicates that states may recover damages on behalf of individual citizens when authorized by specific statutes (e.g., antitrust laws).\n\nTherefore, besides injunctions, a state can:\n\n1. Seek equitable relief (such as orders preventing harmful conduct).\n\n2. Recover damages on behalf of natural-person residents when authorized by statutes allowing parens patriae suits (for example, in antitrust cases).\n\nIn general, the relief a state can obtain under parens patriae depends on the nature of the claim and applicable laws. Injunctive relief is commonly available, while damages for broad economic injuries to the state itself are typically not recoverable by the state as parens patriae.

S phase (Synthesis):\n- DNA replication takes place; each chromosome is duplicated to produce two sister chromatids.\n- The amount of DNA in the cell effectively doubles, but ploidy remains the same.\n- RNA transcription and protein synthesis rates are generally low during this phase, except for histone production which is high to package the new DNA.\n\n3. G2 phase (Gap 2):\n- The cell continues to grow and synthesize proteins in preparation for mitosis.\n- Organelles such as mitochondria divide; in plants, chloroplasts also divide.\n- Microtubules begin to reorganize to form the mitotic spindle.\n- The cell passes the G2 checkpoint ensuring readiness for mitosis.\n\nThese coordinated activities prepare the cell for the subsequent mitotic phase where it divides into two daughter cells.",

It arises because energy is released when the nucleus forms from free nucleons; this energy release corresponds to a loss of mass according to Einstein\u2019s mass-energy equivalence (E=mc\u00b2). The mass defect reflects the nuclear binding energy that holds the nucleus together.\n\n- **Mass excess** is the difference between the mass number (an integer count of nucleons) and the actual isotopic mass measured in atomic mass units. The mass excess arises mainly due to two factors:\n  1. The neutron is slightly heavier than the proton, causing variations depending on neutron-proton ratios.\n  2. Differences in nuclear binding energy among isotopes.\n\nIn summary, the **mass defect** relates to the difference between the combined masses of free nucleons and the nucleus, reflecting the binding energy, whereas the **mass excess** is the difference between the integer mass number and the real isotopic mass, influenced by neutron-proton mass differences and binding energy variations.

They can also influence decisions and behaviors, particularly in areas like marketing, where factors such as the presence of other items, pricing, or physical environment can affect consumer choices and perceptions. For example, context effects help us read difficult handwriting by using surrounding letters to identify ambiguous ones, and they can alter our perception of sounds based on the surrounding noise.

For example, when reading unclear handwriting, people use their knowledge of language and the surrounding letters to identify ambiguous letters correctly. This process allows individuals to fill in missing or unclear information based on context.\n\nFurthermore, top-down processing explains how people can perceive familiar scenes or objects more efficiently by referencing prior experience. It also underlies phenomena such as the Bayesian inference model in perception, where individuals combine sensory data with prior knowledge to make optimal probabilistic decisions.\n\nIn daily life, top-down processing helps us interpret sounds differently depending on surrounding noises or influences our attitudes during situations by incorporating contextual factors. In marketing, top-down processing is involved when consumers are influenced not just by a product itself but by contextual factors such as surrounding products, presentation environment, or even bodily sensations (like comfortable flooring) that affect their perception of product quality.\n\nIn summary, top-down processing in this context emphasizes that perception is not just a passive reception of sensory input but an active interpretative process shaped by prior knowledge and current environmental cues, fundamentally influencing how context effects manifest.",

For example, when recognizing a word written in difficult handwriting, bottom-up processing involves detecting the shapes of individual letters, while top-down processing uses knowledge of language and context to interpret ambiguous letters correctly.\n\nIn summary, bottom-up processing builds perception from sensory input upward, whereas top-down processing interprets sensory input through the lens of existing knowledge and context.",

According to the context provided, Bayesian models are used to explain how individuals combine prior knowledge, experiences, and environmental cues (the \"context\") with incoming sensory data to interpret stimuli and make decisions.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. **Context-Dependent Decision Making:** Bayesian models offer a simple yet powerful way to model how context influences decisions. For example, the paper by Lloyd and Leslie (2013) titled \"Context-dependent decision-making: a simple Bayesian model\" suggests that people update their beliefs and make choices by integrating prior probabilities and new evidence in a mathematically principled way.\n\n2. **Perception and Figure-Ground Effects:** Goldreich and Peterson (2012) demonstrated that a Bayesian observer model can replicate certain context effects such as convexity effects in figure-ground perception. This implies that perception is guided not only by sensory input but also by probabilistic inference using prior knowledge about likely interpretations.\n\n3. **Top-Down Processing:** Bayesian inference embodies top-down processing by formalizing how prior expectations and context influence the interpretation of ambiguous or noisy sensory information. Instead of processing stimuli purely bottom-up from raw data, individuals use Bayesian inference to predict and disambiguate sensory inputs based on context.\n\n4. **Cognitive Models:** Many cognitive models of context effects, such as interactive activation models and other hierarchical models, incorporate Bayesian principles to explain how context shapes perception and memory retrieval.\n\nIn summary, Bayesian inference provides a formal, probabilistic framework that integrates prior knowledge with current sensory evidence to account for the influence of context on perception and decision-making. It effectively bridges sensory data (bottom-up input) and contextual knowledge (top-down processes), explaining how context effects manifest in cognition.",

For example, among bikes priced at $50, $60, and $75, shoppers might typically choose the $60 bike as it represents a balanced choice. However, introducing a higher-priced option (e.g., $100) can shift preferences towards the $75 bike instead.\n\n2. **Attractiveness Effect:** This effect holds that the presence of an item can increase the attractiveness of another similar but superior item. By displaying a similar but inferior item alongside a superior one, consumers are more likely to favor the superior item, boosting its perceived quality and likelihood of purchase.\n\n3. **Similarity Effect:** This effect suggests that when two or more similar items compete in the marketplace, they detract from each other's sales more than dissimilar items would. That is, similar products compete for the same consumers, reducing each other's attractiveness and sales.\n\nThese context effects impact consumer choices and are used strategically by firms to enhance marketing and product positioning.

Contamination of Steel and Consumer Products: Uncontrolled disposal of Co-60 in scrap metal can contaminate steel, leading to radioactive consumer products. For example, steel pet food bowls and metal-studded belts have been recalled or confiscated due to Co-60 contamination.\n\n4. Accidents and Theft: There have been incidents where medical radiation sources containing Co-60 were lost, stolen, or misplaced. Exposure to unshielded Co-60 sources in such cases has caused radiation sickness and death (e.g., the 2000 incident in Bangkok where 10 people were exposed, with 3 deaths).

This descending air spreads toward the equator as trade winds or toward the poles as westerlies. Due to these consistently warm, dry, and sunny conditions, the horse latitudes are the main cause of the world's major non-polar deserts, such as the Sahara Desert, Arabian and Syrian deserts, Mojave and Sonoran deserts in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Atacama, Kalahari, and Australian deserts in the Southern Hemisphere.",

This insulation allows the impulses to \"hop\" or propagate by saltatory conduction between the nodes of Ranvier, rather than traveling continuously along the axon as waves. This results in much faster signal transmission compared to unmyelinated fibers.

It became prominent during the Crimean War and the American Civil War. The significance of the Mini\u00e9 ball lies in its design and the impact it had on firearm technology and warfare.\n\nDesign:\n- The Mini\u00e9 ball was a conical bullet with three exterior grease-filled grooves and a conical hollow in its base.\n- It was designed to expand under the pressure of firing, sealing the barrel (obturation) and engaging the rifling grooves to impart a spin to the bullet.\n- This spin increased the bullet's muzzle velocity, accuracy, and range.\n- An improved version by Captain James H. Burton included a deep cavity at the base that filled with gas upon firing, further expanding the bullet's rim to engage the rifling better.\n\nSignificance:\n- Before the Mini\u00e9 ball, bullets had to be forcefully jammed down rifled barrels, and gunpowder residue would accumulate in the grooves, requiring frequent cleaning.\n- The Mini\u00e9 ball could easily be loaded into the rifle barrel, allowing for faster loading than previous rifle ammunition.\n- Its ability to expand and engage rifling grooves meant rifles could be used effectively over longer distances with greater accuracy.\n- This innovation facilitated the widespread adoption of rifled firearms over smoothbore muskets as the primary battlefield weapons.\n- The Mini\u00e9 ball's higher velocity and mass allowed it to penetrate the human body more effectively than round balls from smoothbore muskets, often causing severe wounds that shattered bones and typically necessitated amputation.\n- Due to these factors, it changed infantry tactics and had significant implications for casualty rates and medical treatment during wars such as the American Civil War.\n\nIn summary, the Mini\u00e9 ball was significant because it combined ease of loading with improved range, accuracy, and lethality, leading to a major shift in firearm use and battlefield outcomes in the mid-19th century.",

The Mini\u00e9 ball typically penetrated the human body in a straight path and rarely remained lodged in the body. When it struck bones, it often shattered them, causing compound fractures that were usually severe enough to necessitate amputation.\n\nAs a result, battlefield medicine had to contend with an increased number of devastating injuries, especially severe bone fractures and compound wounds. These injuries led to a higher rate of amputations among wounded soldiers. Furthermore, the damage caused by the Mini\u00e9 ball, including injuries to major blood vessels, often resulted in serious and life-threatening complications.\n\nIn summary, the Mini\u00e9 ball's design resulted in more severe wounds, increased the frequency of amputations, and posed significant challenges for battlefield surgeons, fundamentally affecting medical treatment during wars such as the American Civil War.",

Development and refinement of amputation techniques: Surgeons improved surgical methods to perform faster and more effective amputations, often necessary to save lives given the extent of bone and tissue damage caused by Mini\u00e9 ball wounds.\n\n2. Greater emphasis on infection control: With the realization that infection was a primary cause of death\u2014as seen in cases of brain injury with subsequent necrosis\u2014efforts increased to improve sanitation in field hospitals and during surgery, paving the way for later adoption of antiseptic practices.\n\n3. Use of anesthesia: The Civil War era saw widespread use of anesthesia (primarily ether and chloroform), which allowed surgeons to perform more extensive and careful surgeries, including repeated debridement and amputations.\n\n4. Advances in wound management and understanding: Military surgeons gained experience in managing compound fractures and contaminated wounds, leading to improved practices such as thorough cleaning and removal of devitalized tissue.\n\n5. Emergence of specialized military field hospitals: To better handle severe injuries, more organized and structured field hospitals were developed, facilitating more effective surgical care.\n\n6. Recognition of the importance of rapid evacuation and treatment: The severity of Mini\u00e9 ball injuries underscored the need for quicker transport of wounded soldiers from the battlefield to surgical facilities.\n\nIn summary, the devastating injuries caused by Mini\u00e9 balls accelerated improvements in surgical amputation procedures, wound management, and awareness of infection control, contributing to the evolution of battlefield medicine.

Roads were often poor, muddy, and impassable during bad weather, hindering ambulance and wagon travel.\n\n2. Limited Ambulance Systems: Early in the war, organized ambulance corps were inadequate or nonexistent. The lack of standardized and efficient ambulance services delayed the removal of wounded from battlefields.\n\n3. Communication Difficulties: Coordinating evacuation efforts was hampered by primitive communication methods. Commanders and medical personnel had difficulty relaying information rapidly about casualties and their locations.\n\n4. Overwhelming Casualty Numbers: Battles often resulted in thousands of casualties, overwhelming available transport and medical personnel. This caused delays in evacuations and triaging patients.\n\n5. Battlefield Conditions: Ongoing fighting, chaotic environments, and the danger of enemy fire made it hazardous to evacuate wounded soldiers promptly.\n\n6. Medical Facilities Capacity: Field hospitals had limited capacity and resources, requiring careful management and sometimes necessitating transfers to larger hospitals further from the front lines.\n\n7. Terrain and Distance: Rough terrain, rivers, and long distances between battlefields and hospitals complicated and slowed transportation.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Civil War saw the emergence and improvement of ambulance corps, the use of railroads for medical evacuation, and more organized field hospitals, which gradually enhanced the speed and efficiency of treating wounded soldiers.

This practice involves focusing on favorable evidence and disregarding unfavorable evidence, which can lead to misleading conclusions. Cherry picking is a logical fallacy and a type of selective attention related to confirmation bias. It can be done intentionally or unintentionally and is a major problem in public debate and scientific research because it suppresses evidence that could provide a more complete and accurate picture of reality. The term \"cherry picking\" is derived from the process of harvesting fruit, such as cherries, where only the ripest and healthiest fruits are selected, potentially giving a false impression that all the fruit on the tree is similarly good.",

Similarly, a one-sided argument (also known as card stacking, stacking the deck, or suppressed evidence) occurs when only reasons supporting a proposition are supplied, while all opposing reasons are omitted. Both practices can mislead an audience by giving an incomplete and distorted picture of the issue, making the argument appear stronger than it actually is.

Camera Mounting and Bracketing: The camera must be securely mounted on the aircraft using a specially designed bracket, ensuring stability and safety during flight.\n\n3. Remote Triggering Mechanism: The camera is triggered remotely, often through mechanical releases or electrical solenoids operated from within the camera aircraft, requiring reliable and tested triggering mechanisms.\n\n4. Pilot Coordination: Pilots must be carefully briefed and coordinate their flying to position the subject aircraft and the camera aircraft correctly during the flight to capture the desired shots.\n\n5. Lens and Camera Selection: Appropriate camera equipment, such as wide-angle lenses (e.g., a 24mm Nikkor lens) and reliable camera bodies, are chosen to suit the remote setup and achieve the desired image quality.\n\n6. Limited Control During Flight: Since the photographer cannot manually adjust the camera once in flight, much brainstorming and planning must be done beforehand to anticipate lighting, angles, and backgrounds.\n\nRemote photography is less common compared to other aviation photography types due to these complexities and logistical requirements.",

The pilots were carefully briefed on the ground, and during the flight, the photographer operated the camera remotely from the back seat of the camera aircraft. The camera used was a Nikkormat with autowind, fitted with a wide-angle 24mm Nikkor lens, and it was triggered using a mechanical release operated by a solenoid through the anti-collision light. This remote photography was commissioned by the Telegraph Sunday Magazine and was featured on the front cover on 3 July 1977.",

McCulloch, who had obtained the land at no cost, to recoup all his expenses on the purchase and shipping of the bridge through the sale of properties. The land development prospered, and since the land had been obtained for free, the income from the property sales covered the costs of the bridge and generated additional profits.\n\nIn recent years, there has been much development in the area of the bridge to increase tourist interest, including revitalization efforts for the original \"English Village,\" an English-style open-air mall with a hedge maze and historical museum, although it had deteriorated with some sections leveled. The Lake Havasu City Convention & Visitors Bureau undertook revitalization efforts, and condos were proposed by the English Village owner in 2011.",

He attacked the new approach Hornan supported, which was based on teaching by example and arranging content by subject rather than strict grammatical structure.\n\nHorman's \"Antibossicon\" took the form of a series of letters addressed to himself and to William Lilye, another grammarian who supported the new humanist teaching approach. It defended the educational methods presented in the \"Vulgaria,\" which aimed to make learning Latin more practical and engaging by using common sayings, examples from daily life, and translations to and from English.

Horman rejected the common vocabulary of Medieval Latin, which tended to be more practical and less classical, and instead strove for a high standard of Latin language based on the works and style of Cicero.

In Benedict's test, reducing sugars can reduce the cupric ions (Cu^2+) in Benedict's reagent to cuprous ions (Cu^+), which then precipitate as insoluble red copper(I) oxide (Cu2O). This reaction generally occurs when the sugar has a free or open-chain form capable of acting as a reducing agent. For example, monosaccharides like glucose and fructose, as well as some disaccharides like lactose and maltose, are reducing sugars because they have a free aldehyde or ketone group available. Non-reducing sugars, such as sucrose, lack this free group due to their glycosidic bond, which prevents the isomerization needed to exhibit reducing properties, and thus do not give a positive Benedict's test unless they are first hydrolyzed into their reducing sugar components.",

India has a significant number of cotton textile mills, with a majority in the private sector.

This over-cheering can make sadness seem like an undesirable or invalid emotion, which may lead the child to suppress or ignore their feelings. As a result, the child might not develop the emotional skills necessary to handle future losses or distress, potentially hindering emotional growth and resilience. Furthermore, Selma Fraiberg emphasizes the importance of respecting a child's right to experience loss fully and deeply, suggesting that allowing sadness is a crucial part of healthy emotional development. Therefore, while comforting a sad child is natural, it is also important to acknowledge and respect their sadness so that the emotion retains its value as a meaningful and necessary experience.",

It is the first single from their second album, \"Toxicity,\" released on August 13, 2001. The song blends alternative metal and nu metal genres and has a length of approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds.\n\nThe song was written by band members Daron Malakian, Serj Tankian, and others, and produced by Daron Malakian, Rick Rubin, and Serj Tankian. It earned System of a Down their first Grammy nomination in 2002 for Best Metal Performance.\n\nMusically, \"Chop Suey!\" starts with a guitar strum and tribal beat, moving into a punk-inspired verse and an ethereal chorus that features a bouzouki, a Greek stringed instrument. The song is known for its dynamic shifts and unique sound.\n\nLyrically, the song discusses themes of death and how people are perceived differently depending on their circumstances. Daron Malakian explained that the song is about the idea that everyone deserves to die, and touches on perceptions of self-righteous suicide. The lyrics reference Jesus' last words on the cross, including phrases like \"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit\" and \"why have you forsaken me?\"\n\nThe original title of the song was \"Suicide,\" but the band changed it to \"Chop Suey!\" for radio-friendliness and as a wordplay referencing \"self-righteous suicide.\" The music video was directed by Marcos Siega and features the band performing surrounded by fans in Los Angeles, with visual effects such as members \"walking through\" one another and teleporting on stage. The video has amassed over 650 million views on YouTube as of December 2017.\n\n\"Chop Suey!\" was released during the week of the September 11, 2001 attacks, leading to some controversy over its lyrics, particularly the line \"I don't think you trust in my self-righteous suicide.\" It was placed on Clear Channel Radio's list of post-9/11 inappropriate songs but was never banned outright.\n\nThe song has been widely covered and parodied by various artists, including Tenacious D, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, Richard Cheese, and Filipino band Parokya ni Edgar.\n\nChart-wise, \"Chop Suey!\" was a moderate success worldwide. It peaked at No. 14 in Australia\u2014System of a Down's highest ranking there\u2014and reached No. 17 in the UK Singles Chart. In the US, it peaked at No. 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 but achieved No. 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nOverall, \"Chop Suey!\" is considered the band's signature song and was ranked number one on Loudwire's list of The Best Hard Rock Songs of the 21st Century.",

The line \"I don't think you trust in my self-righteous suicide\" was particularly sensitive at the time.\n\nDue to this, Clear Channel Radio placed \"Chop Suey!\" on a list of post-9/11 inappropriate songs. While it was never outright banned from the airwaves, Clear Channel Radio stations were advised against playing any songs on this list because their content was deemed potentially insensitive in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.\n\nThis placement was part of a larger effort by some media outlets and companies to avoid songs that could be considered provocative or upsetting during a period of national mourning and heightened sensitivity. The band's original song title was even \"Suicide,\" but they changed it to \"Chop Suey!\" partly to be more radio-friendly.\n\nIn summary, the controversy revolved around the song's themes related to death and suicide, combined with the context of the 9/11 attacks, leading to caution and temporary restriction in certain radio broadcasts.",

Robbie Daw of Idolator complimented the video for adding an extra sheen to the standout track from the album \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans,\" praising its quirky and unconventional style that did not shy away from the dark tone of the song's lyrics. Brian Zacher from AXS.com regarded the video as sharing the \"greatness\" of Bruno Mars's previous video \"Just the Way You Are.\"\n\nOn the other hand, James Montgomery of MTV News provided a mixed review, noting that the video avoided the expected slick and glossy style, instead depicting Mars struggling, sweating, being taunted and tempted, falling and rising again, ending up alone and unloved, with an ambiguous ending where he likely gets hit by a train. Montgomery also appreciated Mars's realness and dramatic, emotional, and clever approach, distinguishing him from other smooth crooners.\n\nThe video earned three nominations at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Male Video, Best Pop Video, and Video of the Year. Additionally, it received a \"Double Platinum\" award at the 2012 MTV Platinum Video Plays Awards for the number of times it was played on MTV channels worldwide. It was also one of the most-watched videos online in the United Kingdom in 2011. Mark Graham of VH1 ranked it as the second-best video of 2011, behind Adele's \"Rolling in the Deep.\"",

In the example, the homeowner and builder mutually agree that paying $4,000 will satisfy the full amount owed (instead of $7,500). This new agreement (the accord) and the partial payment ($4,000\u2014 the satisfaction) form a valid contract with new consideration.\n\nOnce the builder accepts the $4,000 as full payment, both parties release each other from any further claims related to the original obligation. Therefore, the builder waives the right to sue for the remaining $3,500 because the accord and satisfaction discharges the original debt in full.\n\nIf the homeowner fully performs the accord (pays the $4,000), the builder is bound by the accord to accept that amount as satisfaction, and the original debt claim is extinguished.

Without such mutual consent to discharge the entire obligation for the lesser amount, the essential element of accord\u2014a new agreement to settle the original debt\u2014is missing.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, accord and satisfaction would not apply, because there is no accord (no agreement to settle for less). The homeowner's payment would be considered a partial payment only, and the builder would retain the right to sue for the remaining $3,500.\n\nIn summary:  \n- For accord and satisfaction to be valid, there must be mutual agreement that the lesser amount is accepted as full payment.  \n- A statement by the creditor that the payment is only partial and that the balance is still owed negates the accord.  \n- Thus, no discharge of the original debt occurs, and the creditor can demand the remainder.",

Stratovolcanoes commonly form at subduction zones, where oceanic crust is being subducted beneath continental crust or another oceanic plate. In these regions, the magma is often felsic or intermediate in composition, containing higher levels of silica (such as rhyolite, dacite, or andesite). This higher silica content results from the magma incorporating silica-rich crustal rocks as it rises through the Earth's crust.\n\nIn contrast, the example of Mount Nyiragongo shows that not all stratovolcanoes have high-silica magma. Nyiragongo's magma has an unusually low silica content, making it more fluid. This variation can be influenced by differences in the geological environment and magma source regions.\n\nTherefore, silica content is generally related to the volcano's tectonic location and the nature of the magma source, with subduction zones favoring higher silica (more viscous) magmas typical of most stratovolcanoes, but exceptions exist depending on local geology.",

Lava flows: Although usually highly viscous and slow-moving, lava flows from stratovolcanoes can destroy property. Exceptions like Mount Nyiragongo can produce very fluid lava flows moving rapidly downhill.\n\n3. Volcanic bombs: Large rocks explosively ejected during eruptions that can travel over 20 km away from the volcano at high speeds, posing risks to buildings and living beings.\n\n4. Mudflows (Lahars): Mixtures of volcanic debris and water that can range from fast-flowing floods to thick, concrete-like flows, capable of flattening or burying everything downhill. Water sources include rainfall and melting snow or ice caused by volcanic heat.\n\n5. Ashfall: Volcanic ash can threaten health when inhaled, disrupt aviation safety, and cause structural damage if it accumulates significantly, with about 30 cm (12 in) capable of causing building collapses.\n\n6. Climatic effects: Large eruptions like Mount Pinatubo and Mount Tambora can inject aerosols and gases into the stratosphere, leading to global cooling, extreme weather changes, and agricultural distress.\n\nThese hazards combined make stratovolcanoes especially dangerous, particularly near populated areas.",

People may still be influenced by other subjective factors or cultural conditioning when making moral judgments.\n\n3. **Theoretical versus Practical Application**: As a conceptual framework, the veil helps to theorize about justice impartially, but it does not serve as a practical decision-making tool in real-world policymaking or legal contexts.\n\n4. **Different Philosophical Interpretations**: The veil has been interpreted and used differently by various philosophers (e.g., John Harsanyi used it to argue for utilitarianism, while Rawls used it within a social contract framework), leading to debates about its normative implications.\n\nOverall, the criticism highlights that while the veil of ignorance is valuable as an ethical and philosophical device to promote impartiality and fairness, its abstract and hypothetical nature limits its direct applicability and may oversimplify the complexities inherent in social justice and political decision-making.",

However, when fused with BCR, the resulting BCR-ABL protein becomes constitutively active, meaning it is always \"switched on\" without the normal regulatory controls.\n\nThis unregulated tyrosine kinase activity leads to continuous activation of downstream signaling pathways that promote cell cycle progression and cell division. Consequently, cells grow and divide uncontrollably, contributing to the development of cancer, particularly Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and other forms of leukemia.

This idea is illustrated by the repulsive simile of a dog that eats its vomit again, even though this may be harmful or repugnant. In biblical times, dogs were considered unclean scavengers, symbolizing evil, and the reference to vomit indicates excessive indulgence and revulsion.\n\nThus, the proverb emphasizes the incorrigible nature of fools, who persist in their folly much like a dog repeatedly returning to its own vomit. In the context of Proverbs, a \"fool\" represents a person lacking moral behavior or discipline, while the \"wise\" person behaves carefully and righteously. The proverb serves as a warning against repeating foolish or sinful actions.",

When Joyce asks why he went back to Oxford, Endeavour responds that a policeman goes where he's sent. Joyce then tells Endeavour that their father simply said, \"Proverbs 26:11,\" referencing the proverb. Endeavour recognizes the verse and comments that although he has many faults, he tries to draw the line at masochism, noting that traditionally it is the killer who returns to the scene of the crime, not the fool.

In biblical times, dogs were frequently considered scavengers and unclean animals, associated with impurity and low status.\n\nHowever, while dogs are mostly portrayed negatively, there are passages where they appear in a neutral or less negative light. For example, in some New Testament passages, dogs symbolize outsiders or the Gentiles but without inherently evil connotations. Thus, the negative associations with dogs often relate to cultural perceptions of ritual purity and behavior rather than dogs as animals per se.\n\nIn summary, dogs in the Bible are generally viewed unfavorably, often symbolizing impurity, folly, or uncleanliness, but the context and usage determine the extent and nature of their negative portrayal.",

This wedge typically imposes an economic burden on both producers and consumers, but the extent to which each bears the burden depends mainly on the price elasticity of demand and supply:\n\n- If the demand for a product is inelastic (consumers are less sensitive to price changes) relative to the supply, consumers bear a larger share of the tax burden because they will not significantly reduce quantity demanded despite higher prices.\n\n- Conversely, if the supply is more inelastic than demand (producers are less responsive to price changes), producers bear more of the tax burden.\n\nTax incidence does not depend on who the government actually collects the tax from but rather on how the market adjusts through supply and demand responses. For example, even if a tax is collected from producers, if consumers are less sensitive to price changes, producers may raise prices, and consumers end up bearing most of the burden.\n\nThe concept also considers the loss in consumer and producer surplus (economic welfare) caused by taxation, not just the monetary amount paid. This means that even taxes that do not generate revenue (due to eliminated production or consumption) can cause economic harm through lost welfare.\n\nIn summary, tax incidence is about understanding the real economic consequences of a tax\u2014how the burden is shared among different economic agents\u2014and depends heavily on market elasticities rather than on formal legal tax liability.",

Here's an example illustrating this:\n\nImagine a $1 tax imposed on every barrel of apples produced.\n\n1. **Inelastic Demand and Elastic Supply:**  \n   - Consumers are not very sensitive to price changes (inelastic demand), meaning they will continue buying roughly the same quantity even if the price increases.  \n   - Producers are sensitive to price changes (elastic supply), meaning they reduce quantity supplied significantly if the price they receive decreases.  \n   - In this case, producers can pass most or all of the tax onto consumers by raising the price close to $1, because consumers will keep buying despite higher prices.  \n   - **Tax burden falls mostly on consumers.**\n\n2. **Elastic Demand and Inelastic Supply:**  \n   - Consumers are very sensitive to price changes (elastic demand), so a small price increase leads to a large drop in quantity demanded.  \n   - Producers are not sensitive to price changes (inelastic supply) and will produce roughly the same quantity regardless of price.  \n   - Producers cannot increase prices much without losing customers, so they end up absorbing most of the tax burden themselves.  \n   - **Tax burden falls mostly on producers.**\n\n3. **Both Demand and Supply Are Similarly Elastic:**  \n   - Both consumers and producers have similar sensitivity to price changes.  \n   - The tax burden is shared between consumers and producers in varying proportions.  \n   - For example, if the price rises by $0.60 due to a $1 tax, consumers pay $0.60 and producers bear $0.40.  \n\nIn short, the economic principle is: *The group (consumers or producers) that is less responsive to price changes (more inelastic) bears a greater share of the tax burden.*",

However, when the tax revenue is returned in the form of healthcare benefits or other resources that employees value, it effectively increases the employees' overall welfare or utility. This compensation can offset some of the wage reduction or loss in economic welfare caused by the tax.\n\nIn other words, while employees may bear some of the financial burden upfront via lower wages, the direct benefits they receive improve their net position, potentially resulting in a smaller net loss\u2014or even a net gain\u2014in economic welfare. Consequently, the true incidence of the tax, when accounting for the benefits received, shifts because the loss in income is partially or wholly compensated by the value of the benefits.\n\nTherefore, the calculation of tax incidence should consider not only who pays the tax or bears the reduction in wages but also how the tax revenues are utilized. If tax proceeds directly benefit the affected group (employees), the net economic burden on that group is reduced, changing the overall distribution of tax incidence among employers, employees, and potentially consumers.",

However, the distribution of the burden varies among individuals depending on their consumption patterns:\n\n- Those who consume more imported goods pay more in taxes and may effectively end up paying more net tax.\n- Those who consume fewer or no imported goods pay less or no tax on imports but still receive the dividend, potentially resulting in a net gain in utility.\n\nThus, the tax incidence in terms of economic burden is modified by the redistribution mechanism. The use of tax revenues to provide a universal benefit changes the effective impact of the tax on different groups, similar to how using healthcare tax revenues to directly benefit employees changes the net burden on workers.",

This reduction in traded quantity results in a loss of economic welfare known as deadweight loss, representing the lost consumer and producer surplus.\n\nWhile the dividend redistribution can offset part of the financial burden faced by consumers by returning the tax revenue to them, it does not fully eliminate the market distortions caused by the tax. Some trades no longer occur because they are no longer profitable or worthwhile at the taxed prices, meaning some mutually beneficial transactions are foregone. Therefore, despite the redistribution improving overall income or utility for individuals, the economy still experiences an efficiency loss resulting from reduced production and consumption.\n\nIn summary, redistribution mechanisms like a citizen\u2019s dividend can mitigate the distributional effect of a tax and improve net welfare for some individuals, but they do not fully remove the economic harm associated with lost consumer and producer surplus arising from the tax-induced market distortions.",

Nominal tax incidence (who writes the check) is not necessarily the same as the actual economic burden, and market forces can significantly alter the nominal incidence of different types of taxes in various circumstances.

Because of this industry, North Carolina was sometimes called the \"Tar and Turpentine State,\" and its residents were derisively nicknamed \"Tarboilers.\"\n\nThe term \"Tar Heel\" itself gained popularity during the American Civil War, initially used as a pejorative term. One popular legend attributes the nickname to North Carolina troops who \"stuck to their ranks like they had tar on their heels\" during battle, reflecting their tenacity. Over time, especially after the Civil War around 1865, North Carolinians began to embrace the term with pride.\n\nThere are several legendary explanations and early documented uses of the term, including:\n\n- British troops allegedly found their feet tarred when crossing North Carolina's Tar River during the Revolutionary War.\n- North Carolina soldiers were said to have held their ground in battle while others retreated, leading to playful references about putting tar on soldiers' heels to help them \"stick\" better in battle.\n- General Robert E. Lee reportedly blessed the \"Tar Heel boys,\" reinforcing the positive association.\n- The earliest written use is found in a diary entry from February 6, 1863, by 2nd Lieutenant Jackson B.A. Lowrance, noting an understanding of what \"Tar Heels\" meant.\n\nOverall, the nickname is tied closely to North Carolina's naval stores industry and the reputation of its soldiers' steadfastness in battle.",

However, North Carolina troops embraced the term as a symbol of their tenacity and steadfastness in battle. For instance, after a battle in Virginia, other troops jokingly suggested putting tar on soldiers' heels to make them \"stick\" better in fights, and North Carolinians adopted this idea proudly.\n\n3. General Robert E. Lee reportedly expressed appreciation by saying, \"God bless the Tar-heel boys,\" which further legitimized and honored the nickname.\n\n4. North Carolina Governor Vance, in a speech to troops, admitted he did not know how to address them and finally called them \"Tar Heels\" with pride.\n\n5. In 1893, students of the University of North Carolina founded a newspaper named The Tar Heel (later The Daily Tar Heel), signifying the term's positive acceptance.\n\n6. By the early 1900s, the term was widely embraced as a non-derisive nickname for North Carolinians both within and outside the state.\n\nThese examples illustrate the transition of \"Tar Heel\" from an insult to a badge of honor.",

For example:\n\n- In Congress on February 10, 1875, an African American representative from South Carolina used the term \"tar-heels\" in a negative context, describing some whites as \"the class of men thrown up by the war, that rude class of men I mean, the 'tar-heels' and the 'sand-hillers,' and the 'dirt eaters' of the South -- it is with that class we have all our trouble...\"\n\n- The 1884 edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica used the term derogatorily, reporting that people living in the region of pine forests were \"far superior to the tar heel, the nickname of the dwellers in barrens.\"\n\n- In 1903, The New York Tribune stated regarding some North Carolinians that \"the men really like to work, which is all but incomprehensible to the true 'tar heel'.\"\n\nThese examples show that despite the general shift to a badge of honor, some usage of \"Tar Heel\" remained negative, at least in some contexts and by some individuals, even decades after the Civil War.",

River Fording by General Cornwallis Legend: During the American Revolutionary War, British General Cornwallis's troops were fording the Tar River in North Carolina when they found tar had been dumped into the river to impede their crossing. After crossing, their feet were found to be completely black with tar. This led to the idea that anyone who waded through North Carolina rivers would acquire \"tar heels.\"\n\n2. North Carolina's Naval Stores Industry: Early in the colony's history, North Carolina was a major producer and exporter of naval stores such as tar, pitch, and turpentine from its vast pine forests. Tar and pitch were used to seal British wooden ships. Because of this industry, North Carolina was sometimes called the \"Tar and Turpentine State,\" and its residents were derisively nickname \"Tarboilers.\" The nickname Tar Heel evolved from this association with the tar industry.\n\nThese explanations highlight the connection of the nickname to North Carolina's natural resources and strategic geographic features, aside from the Civil War's military reputation stories.",

Ultimately, Dr. Loomis used Jamie as bait to lure Michael into the old Myers house to trap him. The telepathic bond highlighted Jamie's strong connection to her uncle, Michael Myers, and contributed to the storyline of her being closely linked to his violent actions.",

Before Michael kills her, Jamie hides her baby, who is later found by Tommy. In the film, the Man in Black is revealed to be Dr. Terence Wynn, Loomis's former medical colleague. Wynn and his staff belong to a Druid cult that placed an ancient curse on Michael to kill his family to ward off sickness and death.\n\nThe theatrical version of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers shows Jamie dying relatively early in the film when Michael impales her on a corn thresher and disembowels her.

They receive qualifying offers from their teams and can negotiate with other clubs until a deadline (approximately a week before the NFL Draft). The original team has the right to match any offer the player receives. If the original team declines to match, it may receive draft pick compensation depending on the qualifying offer level.\n\n- Unrestricted Free Agents (UFAs): Players who have completed four or more accrued seasons and whose contracts have expired. They are free to sign with any team without restrictions.\n\n- Undrafted Free Agents: Players who were eligible for the NFL Draft but were not selected. They can sign with any team.\n\nRegarding deadlines, the NFL has a free agency period culminating around the time of the NFL Draft, after which restricted free agent rights revert to the original club if offers have not been matched.\n\nAdditionally, the NFL imposes rules such as the salary cap to prevent bidding wars and maintain competitive balance among teams.",

Behind the left field wall was a mental institution where patients could be heard making strange and bizarre comments, so someone \"way out in left field\" could be questioning another's sanity, comparing them with a mental patient.

It expresses the idea that the African native's identity, wisdom, and worldview are deeply rooted in and inseparable from the natural world\u2014the earth, sky, air, seas, rivers, fishes, animals, and trees. This connection embodies vitality, intellectual depth, and spiritual warmth, contrasting with the colonialist's cold, mocking \"ice-block laughter.\" Being \"owned\" by this living warmth suggests a belonging to and being nourished by the essential life force of the earth, which grounds indigenous beliefs as rich, valid, and deeply intellectual rather than primitive or ignorant. In the poem, this phrase encapsulates the source of the native's \"fire\" laughter that ultimately \"thaws\" the colonialist's frozen insides and challenges his dismissive attitude.",

            "content": "Yes, the poem \"You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed\" by Gabriel Okara does suggest a form of resolution to the conflict between the colonialist and the native. The poem portrays an initial derision by the colonialist who mocks the native's songs, dance, and worldview with \"ice-block laughter,\" which symbolizes coldness, ignorance, and dismissal. However, the native responds with a \"fire\" laughter, symbolizing warmth, vitality, and deep connection to the earth and cultural wisdom. This laughter \"thaws\" the colonialist's frozen insides and senses, leading the colonialist to experience \"a meek wonder\" and to question \"Why so?\" The native then explains that this laughter comes from being \"owned by the living warmth of the earth through our naked feet,\" affirming a profound and authentic bond with nature and intellectual depth.\n\nThis exchange suggests a transformative moment where the colonialist begins to move from mockery to reflection and a tentative openness to understanding the native perspective. While this may not indicate a complete or total resolution, the poem concludes with a significant shift: the silence of colonial mockery and the assertion of the native's intellectual and spiritual resilience. Thus, the poem proposes a hopeful reconciliation through mutual recognition and the power of the native's cultural identity to challenge and soften colonial arrogance.",

            "content": "Gabriel Okara's poem \"You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed\" relates to other African literature dealing with colonialism through its engagement with the trope of colonial derision toward indigenous African culture. Like many works in African literature, it portrays the encounter between the African native and the white colonialist, highlighting the colonialist's mockery and contempt for African beliefs, practices, and worldview\u2014often encapsulated by the figure of \"The White Man Laughed.\"\n\nHowever, Okara's poem transcends mere depiction of colonial mockery by presenting the African native as a wiser intellectual who ultimately challenges and overcomes the colonialist's ignorance. Through symbolic elements such as the contrast between the colonialist's cold \"ice-block laughter\" and the native's warm \"fire\" laughter, the poem asserts the vitality, depth, and intellectual richness of African culture, countering colonial assumptions of primitiveness or inferiority.\n\nThis reflective and assertive approach aligns with broader African postcolonial literature themes that confront colonialism's cultural denigration while reclaiming indigenous identity and dignity. The poem's resolution, where the native's laughter \"thaws\" the colonialist's frozen derision and evokes \"a meek wonder,\" suggests a hopeful, transformative possibility, distinguishing it as a significant contribution to African literary responses to colonialism that move from resistance to dialogue and affirmation.",
