    "title": "Making out",
    "document": "Making out - wikipedia Making out Jump to : navigation , search `` Snog '' redirects here . For the Australian band , see Snog ( band ) . `` Petting '' redirects here . For stroking an animal , see Social grooming . For other uses of `` making out '' , see Make out ( disambiguation ) . A silhouette of a couple making out Making out is a term of American origin , dating back to at least 1949 , and is used variously to refer to kissing , petting , and necking , but may also refer to non-penetrative sex acts such as heavy petting . Snogging has roughly the same meaning in British English and some related varieties of English , except in Hiberno - English ( spoken in Ireland ) , where it is more commonly known as shifting . Contents ( hide ) 1 History 2 Characteristics 3 See also 4 References History ( edit ) The sexual connotations of the phrase `` make out '' appear to have developed in the 1930s and 1940s from the phrase 's other meanings of `` to succeed '' . Originally , it meant `` to seduce '' or `` to have sexual intercourse with '' . Studies indicate that at the beginning of the 20th century , premarital sex increased , and with it , petting behavior in the 1920s . The Continental experience at that time is amusingly illustrated by a letter that Sigmund Freud wrote to Sándor Ferenczi in 1931 playfully admonishing him to stop kissing his patients , in which Freud warned lest `` a number of independent thinkers in matters of technique will say to themselves : Why stop at a kiss ? Certainly one gets further when one adopts ' pawing ' as well , which , after all , does n't make a baby . And then bolder ones will come along who will go further , to peeping and showing -- and soon we shall have accepted in the technique of analysis the whole repertoire of demi - viergerie and petting parties '' . By the postwar period , necking and petting became accepted behavior in mainstream American culture , as long as the partners were dating , and became the subject of numerous jokes : ' He : `` Darling , I 'm groping for words . '' She : `` You wo n't find them there . '' ( N.Y. 1940 ) ' . Characteristics ( edit ) Making out is usually considered an expression of affection or sexual attraction . An episode of making out is frequently referred to as a `` make - out session '' or simply `` making out , '' depending on the speaker 's vernacular . It covers a wide range of sexual behavior , and means different things to different age groups in different parts of the United States . It typically refers to kissing , including prolonged , passionate , open - mouth kissing ( also known as French kissing ) , and intimate skin - to - skin contact . The term can also refer to other forms of foreplay such as heavy petting , which typically involves some genital stimulation , but usually not the direct act of penetrative sexual intercourse . The perceived significance of making out may be affected by the age and relative sexual experience of the participants . Teenagers sometimes play party games in which making out is the main activity as an act of exploration . Games in this category include seven minutes in heaven and spin the bottle . Teenagers may have had social gatherings in which making out was the predominant event . In the United States , these events were referred to as `` make - out parties '' and would sometimes be confined to a specific area , called the `` make - out room '' . These make - out parties were generally not regarded as sex parties , though heavy petting may have been involved , depending on the group .

        "rag_input": "So, if 'snogging' is the British term, does it cover the full range of activities that 'making out' does, including, say, heavy petting?",
        "question": "Given that 'snogging' is identified as a British English term for 'making out', does its meaning encompass the same spectrum of activities as 'making out', including instances of heavy petting?",
        "answer": "Making out is a term of American origin, dating back to at least 1949 , and is used variously to refer to kissing , petting , and necking , but may also refer to non-penetrative sex acts such as heavy petting . Snogging has roughly the same meaning in British English.",
        "type": "Follow-up",
        "rag_answer": "Based on the provided context and information, \"snogging\" in British English generally refers to kissing and intimate physical contact. While \"making out\" can encompass a wider range of activities—from kissing to passionate physical contact and even escalating into heavy petting—\"snogging\" typically focuses on kissing and related affectionate behavior.\n\n\"Heavy petting\" is specifically used to describe more intense physical contact beyond kissing. Therefore, \"snogging\" does not fully cover the entire range of activities implied by \"making out,\" particularly when it comes to heavy petting. In summary, while \"snogging\" corresponds to the kissing aspect of making out, the broader scope including heavy petting is more directly expressed by terms like \"heavy petting\" itself in British English.",

Lake Kariba is the world 's largest man - made lake and reservoir by volume . It lies 1300 kilometres upstream from the Indian Ocean , along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe . Lake Kariba was filled between 1958 and 1963 following the completion of the Kariba Dam at its northeastern end , flooding the Kariba Gorge on the Zambezi River . The Zimbabwean town of Kariba was built for construction workers on the lake 's dam , while some other settlements such as Binga village and Mlibizi in Zimbabwe and Siavonga and Sinazongwe in Zambia have grown up to house people displaced by the rising waters . Contents ( hide ) 1 Physical characteristics 2 Ecology 3 Protected areas 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Physical characteristics ( edit ) Lake Kariba is over 223 kilometres ( 139 miles ) long and up to 40 kilometres ( 25 miles ) in width . It covers an area of 5,580 square kilometres ( 6.01 × 10 square feet ) mi ) and its storage capacity is 185 cubic kilometres ( 44 cubic miles ) . The mean depth of the lake is 29 metres ( 95 feet ) ; the maximum depth is 97 metres ( 318 feet ) . It is the world 's largest man - made reservoir , four times as large as the Three Gorges Dam . The enormous mass of water ( approximately 180,000,000,000,000 kilograms , or 180 petagrams ( 200 billion tons ) ) is believed to have caused induced seismicity in the seismically active region , including over 20 earthquakes of greater than 5 magnitude on the Richter scale . The lake has several islands , including Maaze Island , Mashape Island , Chete Island , Sekula , Sampa Karuma , Fothergill , Spurwing , Snake Island , Antelope Island , Bed Island , and Chikanka . Ecology ( edit ) Kariba Dam Before Lake Kariba was filled , the existing vegetation was burned , creating a thick layer of fertile soil on land that would become the lake bed . As a result , the ecology of Lake Kariba is vibrant . A number of fish species have been introduced to the lake , notably the sardine - like kapenta ( transported from Lake Tanganyika ) , which now supports a thriving commercial fishery . Other inhabitants of Lake Kariba include Nile crocodiles and hippopotami . Gamefish , particularly tigerfish , which was among the indigenous species of the Zambezi river system , now thrive on the kapenta , which in turn encourages tourism . Both Zambia and Zimbabwe are now attempting to develop the tourism industry along their respective coasts of Lake Kariba . Fish eagles , cormorants and other water birds patrol the shorelines , as do occasional herds of elephants . Protected areas ( edit ) The portion of Lake Kariba which falls within Zimbabwe has been designated a Recreational Park within the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Estate .

The eastern end of the Straits was controlled by Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island , a British colonial and early American military base and fur trade center , founded in 1781 . With the advent of European exploration into the area in the late 17th century , Lake Michigan became part of a line of waterways leading from the Saint Lawrence River to the Mississippi River and thence to the Gulf of Mexico . French coureurs des bois and voyageurs established small ports and trading communities , such as Green Bay , on the lake during the late 17th and early 18th centuries . In the 19th century , Lake Michigan played a major role in the development of Chicago and the Midwestern United States west of the lake . For example , 90 % of the grain shipped from Chicago traveled east over Lake Michigan during the antebellum years , and only rarely falling below 50 % after the Civil War and the major expansion of railroad shipping . The first person to reach the deep bottom of Lake Michigan was J. Val Klump , a scientist at the University of Wisconsin -- Milwaukee . Klump reached the bottom via submersible as part of a 1985 research expedition . In 2007 , a row of stones paralleling an ancient shoreline was discovered by Mark Holley , professor of underwater archeology at Northwestern Michigan College . This formation lies 40 feet ( 12 m ) below the surface of the lake . One of the stones is said to have a carving resembling a mastodon . So far the formation has not been authenticated . Geography Lake Michigan bathymetric map . The deepest point is marked with `` × '' . Lake Michigan basin Lake Michigan is the only one of the Great Lakes wholly within the borders of the United States ; the others are shared with Canada . It lies in the region known as the American Midwest . Statistics and Bathymetry Lake Michigan has a surface area of 22,404 sq. mi ( 58,026 km ) ; ( 13,237 square miles , 34,284 km lying in Michigan state , 7,358 square miles , 19,056 km in Wisconsin , 234 square miles , 606 km in Indiana , & 1,576 square miles , 4,079 km in Illinois ) making it the largest lake entirely within one country by surface area ( Lake Baikal , in Russia , is larger by water volume ) , and the fifth - largest lake in the world . It is the larger half of Lake Michigan -- Huron , which is the largest body of fresh water in the world by surface area . It is 307 miles ( 494 km ) long by 118 miles ( 190 km ) wide with a shoreline 1,640 miles ( 2,640 km ) long . The lake 's average depth is 46 fathoms 3 feet ( 279 ft ; 85 m ) , while its greatest depth is 153 fathoms 5 feet ( 923 ft ; 281 m ) . It contains a volume of 1,180 cubic miles ( 4,918 km3 ) of water . Green Bay in the northwest is its largest bay . Grand Traverse Bay in its northeast is another large bay . Lake Michigan 's deepest region , which lies in its northern - half , is called Chippewa Basin ( named after prehistoric Lake Chippewa ) and is separated from South Chippewa Basin , by a relatively shallower area called the Mid Lake Plateau . Cities The Milwaukee lakefront Twelve million people live along Lake Michigan 's shores , mainly in the Chicago and Milwaukee metropolitan areas . The economy of many communities in northern Michigan and Door County , Wisconsin is supported by tourism , with large seasonal populations attracted by the beauty and recreational opportunities offered by Lake Michigan . Seasonal residents often have summer homes along the waterfront and return home for the winter . The southern tip of the lake near Gary , Indiana is heavily industrialized . Cities on the shores of Lake Michigan include : Illinois Chicago Evanston Glencoe Highland Park Kenilworth Lake Forest Lake Bluff North Chicago Waukegan Wilmette Winnetka Zion Indiana East Chicago Gary Hammond Michigan City Portage Porter Whiting Michigan Benton Harbor Bridgman Charlevoix Douglas",

    "title": "Subsistence agriculture",
    "document": "Subsistence agriculture - wikipedia Subsistence agriculture Like most farmers in Africa , this Cameroonian man cultivates at the subsistence level . Subsistence agriculture is a self - sufficiency farming system in which the farmers focus on growing enough food to feed themselves and their entire families . The output is mostly for local requirements with little or no surplus trade . The typical subsistence farm has a range of crops and animals needed by the family to feed and clothe themselves during the year . Planting decisions are made principally with an eye toward what the family will need during the coming year , and secondarily toward market prices . Tony Waters writes : `` Subsistence peasants are people who grow what they eat , build their own houses , and live without regularly making purchases in the marketplace . '' However , despite the primacy of self - sufficiency in subsistence farming , today most subsistence farmers also participate in trade to some degree , though usually it is for goods that are not necessary for survival , and may include sugar , iron roofing sheets , bicycles , used clothing , and so forth . Most subsistence farmers today reside in developing countries , although their amount of trade as measured in cash is less than that of consumers in countries with modern complex markets , many have important trade contacts and trade items that they can produce because of their special skills or special access to resources valued in the marketplace . Subsistence agriculture also emerged independently in Mexico where it was based on maize cultivation , and the Andes where it was based on the domestication of the potato . Subsistence agriculture was the dominant mode of production in the world until recently , when market - based capitalism became widespread . Subsistence horticulture may have developed independently in South East Asia and Papua New Guinea . Subsistence farming continues today in large parts of rural Africa , and parts of Asia and Latin America . In 2015 , about 2 billion people ( slightly more than 25 % of the world 's population ) in 500 million households living in rural areas of developing nations survive as `` smallholder '' farmers , working less than 2 hectares ( 5 acres ) of land . Subsistence agriculture had largely disappeared in Europe by the beginning of World War I , and in North America with the movement of sharecroppers and tenant farmers out of the American South and Midwest during the 1930s and 1940s . As recently as the 1950s , it was still common on family farms in North America and Europe to grow much of a family 's own food and make much of its own clothing , although sales of some of the farm 's production earned enough currency to buy certain staples , typically including sugar ; coffee and tea ; petroleum distillates ( petrol , kerosene , fuel oil ) ; textile products such as bolts of cloth , needles , and thread ; medicines ; hardware products such as nails , screws , and wire ; and a few discretionary items such as candy or books . Many of the preceding items , as well as occasional services from physicians , veterinarians , blacksmiths , and others , were often bought with barter rather than currency . In Central and Eastern Europe subsistence and semi-subsistence agriculture reappeared within the transition economy since about 1990 . Contents ( hide ) 1 Types of subsistence farming 1.1 Shifting agriculture 1.2 Primitive agriculture 1.3 Nomadic herding 1.4 Intensive subsistence farming 2 Poverty alleviation 3 See also 4 References 5 Further reading Types of subsistence farming ( edit ) Shifting agriculture ( edit ) Main article : Shifting cultivation In this type of agriculture , a patch of forest land is cleared by a combination of felling and burning , and crops are grown . After 2 - 3 years the fertility of the soil begins to decline , the land is abandoned and the farmer moves to clear a fresh piece of land elsewhere in the forest as the process continues . While the land is left fallow the forest regrows in the cleared area and soil fertility and biomass is restored . After a decade or more , the farmer may return to the first piece of land . This form of agriculture is sustainable at low population densities , but higher population loads require more frequent clearing which prevents soil fertility from recovering , opens up more of the forest canopy , and encourages scrub at the expense of large trees , eventually resulting in deforestation and land erosion . Shifting cultivation is called Dredd in India , Ladang in Indonesia , Milpa in Central America and Mexico and Jhumming in North East India . Primitive agriculture ( edit ) While this ' slash - and - burn ' technique may describe the method for opening new land , commonly the farmers in question have in existence at the same time smaller fields , sometimes merely gardens , near the homestead there they practice intensive ' non-shifting '' techniques until shortage of fields where they can employ `` slash and burn '' to clear land and ( by the burning ) provide fertilizer ( ash ) . Such gardens nearer the homestead often regularly receive household refuse , the manure of any household chickens or goats , and compost piles where refuse is thrown initially just to get it out of the way . However , such farmers often recognize the value of such compost and apply it regularly to their smaller fields . They also may irrigate part of such fields if they are near a source of water . In some areas of tropical Africa , at least , such smaller fields may be ones in which crops are grown on raised beds . Thus farmers practicing ' slash and burn ' agriculture are often much more sophisticated agriculturalists than the term `` slash and burn '' subsistence farmers suggest . Nomadic herding ( edit ) In this type of farming people migrate along with their animals from one place to another in search of fodder for their animals . Generally they rear cattle , sheep , goats , camels and / or yaks for milk , skin , meat and wool . This way of life is common in parts of central and western Asia , India , east and south - west Africa and northern Eurasia . Examples are the nomadic Bhotiyas and Gujjars of the Himalayas . They carry their belongings , such as tents , etc ... , on the backs of donkeys , horses , and camels . In mountainous regions , like Tibet and The Andes , Yak and Llama are reared . Reindeer are the livestock in arctic and sub-arctic areas . Sheep , goats , and camels are common animals , and cattle and horses are also important ... Intensive subsistence farming ( edit ) In intensive subsistence agriculture , the farmer cultivates a small plot of land using simple tools and more labour . Climate , with large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils permits growing of more than one crop annually on the same plot . Farmers use their small land holdings to produce enough , for their local consumption , while remaining produce is used for exchange against other goods . It results in much more food being produced per acre compared to other subsistence patterns . In the most intensive situation , farmers may even create terraces along steep hillsides to cultivate rice paddies . Such fields are found in densely populated parts of Asia , such as in The Philippines . They may also intensify by using manure , artificial irrigation and animal waste as fertilizer . Intensive subsistence farming is prevalent in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south , southwest , and east Asia . Poverty alleviation ( edit ) Subsistence agriculture can be used as a poverty alleviation strategy , specifically as a safety net for food - price shocks and for food security . Poor countries are limited in fiscal and institutional resources that would allow them to contain rises in domestic prices as well as to manage social assistance programs , which is often because they are using policy tools that are intended for middle - and high - income countries . Low - income countries tend to have populations in which 80 % of poor are in rural areas and more than 90 % of rural households have access to land , yet a majority of these rural poor have insufficient access to food . Subsistence agriculture can be used in low - income countries as a part of policy responses to a food crisis in the short and medium term , and provide a safety net for the poor in these countries .

    "document": "Fire triangle - wikipedia Fire triangle This article needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( November 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The Fire Triangle . The Fire Triangle or Combustion Triangle or '' Fire Diamond '' are simple models for understanding the necessary ingredients for most fires . The triangle illustrates the three elements a fire needs to ignite : heat , fuel , and an oxidizing agent ( usually oxygen ) . A fire naturally occurs when the elements are present and combined in the right mixture , meaning that fire is actually an event rather than a thing . A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing any one of the elements in the fire triangle . For example , covering a fire with a fire blanket removes the oxygen part of the triangle and can extinguish a fire . In large fires where firefighters are called in , decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is no effective way to make that happen in an extended area . Contents ( hide ) 1 Fire Tetrahedron 2 Oxidizer 3 Extinction of the fire 4 Role of water in fire - fighting 5 Multi-scale fire triangles for wildland fires 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References Fire tetrahedron ( edit ) Not to be confused with NFPA 704 , also called the fire diamond . The fire tetrahedron The fire tetrahedron represents the addition of a component in the chemical chain reaction , to the three already present in the fire triangle . Once a fire has started , the resulting exothermic chain reaction sustains the fire and allows it to continue until or unless at least one of the elements of the fire is blocked . Foam can be used to deny the fire the oxygen it needs . Water can be used to lower the temperature of the fuel below the ignition point or to remove or disperse the fuel . Halon can be used to remove free radicals and create a barrier of inert gas in a direct attack on the chemical reaction responsible for the fire . Combustion is the chemical reaction that feeds a fire more heat and allows it to continue . When the fire involves burning metals like lithium , magnesium , titanium , etc. ( known as a class - D fire ) , it becomes even more important to consider the energy release . The metals react faster with water than with oxygen and thereby more energy is released . Putting water on such a fire results in the fire getting hotter or even exploding . Carbon dioxide extinguishers are ineffective against certain metals such as titanium . Therefore , inert agents ( e.g. dry sand ) must be used to break the chain reaction of metallic combustion . In the same way , as soon as one of the four elements of the tetrahedron is removed , combustion stops . Oxidizer ( edit ) The oxidizer is the other reactant of the chemical reaction . In most cases , it is the ambient air , and in particular one of its components , oxygen ( O ) . By depriving a fire of air , it can be extinguished ; for example , when covering the flame of a small candle with an empty glass , fire stops ; to the contrary , if air is blown over a wood fire with bellows , the fire is activated by the introduction of more air . In certain torches , gaseous oxygen is introduced to improve combustion . Some chemicals , such as fluorine gas , perchlorate salts such as ammonium perchlorate , or chlorine trifluoride , act as oxidisers , sometimes more powerful ones than oxygen itself . A fire based on a reaction with these oxidisers can be very difficult to put out until the oxidiser is exhausted ; that leg of the fire triangle can not be broken by normal means ( i.e. , depriving it of air will not smother it ) . In certain cases such as some explosives , the oxidizer and combustible are the same ( e.g. , nitroglycerin , an unstable molecule that has oxidizing parts in the same molecule as the oxidizeable parts ) . Reaction is initiated by an activating energy , in most cases , it is heat . Several examples include friction , as in case of matches , heating an electrical wire , a flame ( propagation of fire ) , or a spark ( from a lighter or from any starting electrical device ) . There are also many other ways to bring sufficient activation energy including electricity , radiation , and pressure , all of which will lead to a temperature rise . In most cases , heat production enables self - sustainability of the reaction , and enables a chain reaction to grow . The temperature at which a liquid produces sufficient vapor to get a flammable mix with self - sustainable combustion is called its flash - point . Extinction of the fire ( edit ) To stop a combustion reaction , one of the three elements of the fire - triangle has to be removed . Without sufficient heat , a fire can not begin , and it can not continue . Heat can be removed by the application of a substance which reduces the amount of heat available to the fire reaction . This is often water , which absorbs heat for phase change from water to steam . Introducing sufficient quantities and types of powder or gas in the flame reduces the amount of heat available for the fire reaction in the same manner . Scraping embers from a burning structure also removes the heat source . Turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes the ignition source . Without fuel , a fire will stop . Fuel can be removed naturally , as where the fire has consumed all the burnable fuel , or manually , by mechanically or chemically removing the fuel from the fire . Fuel separation is an important factor in wildland fire suppression , and is the basis for most major tactics , such as controlled burns . The fire stops because a lower concentration of fuel vapor in the flame leads to a decrease in energy release and a lower temperature . Removing the fuel thereby decreases the heat . Without sufficient oxygen , a fire can not begin , and it can not continue . With a decreased oxygen concentration , the combustion process slows . Oxygen can be denied to a fire using a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher , a fire blanket or water . Role of water in fire - fighting ( edit ) Water can have two different roles . In the case of a solid combustible , the solid fuel produce pyrolyzing products under the influence of heat , commonly radiation . This process is halted by the application of water , since water is more easily evaporated than the fuel is pyrolyzed . Thereby energy is removed from the fuel surface and it is cooled and the pyrolysis is stopped , removing the fuel supply to the flames . In fire fighting , this is referred to as surface cooling . In the gas phase , i.e. in the flames or in the smoke , the combustible can not be separated from the oxidizer , and the only possible action consists of cooling down . In this case , water droplets are evaporated in the gas phase , thereby lowering the temperature and adding water vapour making the gas mixture non combustible . This requires droplets of a size less than about 0.2 mm . In fire fighting , this is referred to as gas cooling or smoke cooling . Cases also exist where the ignition factor is not the activation energy . For example , a smoke explosion is a very violent combustion of unburned gases contained in the smoke created by a sudden fresh air input ( oxidizer input ) . The interval in which an air / gas mix can burn is limited by the explosive limits of the air . This interval can be very small ( kerosene ) or large ( acetylene ) . Water can not be used on certain type of fires : Fires where live electricity is present -- as water conducts electricity it presents an electrocution hazard . Hydrocarbon fires -- as it will only spread the fire because of the difference in density / hydrophobicity . For example , adding water to a fire with an oil source will cause the oil to spread , since oil and water do not mix . Metal fires -- as these fires produce huge amounts of energy ( up to 7.550 calories / kg for aluminium ) and water can also create violent chemical reactions with burning metal ( possibly even serving as an additional oxidizing agent ) . Since these reactions are well understood , it has been possible to create specific water - additives which will allow : A better heat absorption with a higher density than water . Carrying free radical catchers on the fire . Carrying foaming agents to enable water to stay on the surface of a liquid fire and prevent gas release . Carrying specific reactives which will react and change the nature of the burning material . Water - additives are generally designed to be effective on several categories of fires ( class A + class B or even class A + class B + class F ) , meaning a better global performance and usability of a single extinguisher on many different types of fires ( or fires that involve several different classes of materials ) . Multi-scale fire triangles for wildland fires ( edit ) Multi-scale fire triangles describing the elements of wildland fire at the scale of the flame , a wildfire , and a fire regime . Adapted from Moritz et al. ( 2005 ) Wildfire , complexity , and highly optimized tolerance . Proceedings of the National Academy of Science 102 , 17912 - 17917 . In the context of wildland fire , the fire triangle can be scaled up to apply to understand fire spread over landscapes ( scales of days and several km ) and recurrence of fire over time ( scales of decades and hundreds of km ) . Thus , while heat is important to ignite a flame , topography is important for aiding fire spread especially by preheating upslope fuels , and ignitions sources are important to help explain recurrence on longer time scales . Similarly , while oxygen is relevant to sustain a flame , weather and associated winds feed oxygen into a spreading fire , and the longer - term pattern of weather is summarized as climate . Lastly , fuels is the term to describe what burns in a single flame to the range of materials burnt in a spreading wildfire , but fuels vary over larger space and time scales in what is called vegetation . At the smallest scale , the combustion fire triangle , individual fuel particles are ignited once at a critical temperature , and fire transfers energy to the nearest surroundings . Combustion events range on the scale of several seconds to a couple of days and their effects are monitored at the quadrant scale . The largest scale , in contrast , describes the fire regime concept . Global climate change drives drives many of the factors involved in the ' wildfire ' and the ' fire regime ' triangles . For example , with respect to the fire regime , a particular vegetation type will support a characteristic fire in terms of recurrence , intensity , seasonality and biological effects ; a change in vegetation type will have implications for a changing fire regime .

According to the fire tetrahedron model, removing or blocking any one of the four components—heat, fuel, oxidizing agent, or the chemical chain reaction itself—will stop the fire. Specifically, certain extinguishing agents can target the chemical chain reaction directly. For example, Halon can remove free radicals and create a barrier of inert gas that interrupts the chemical reaction responsible for the fire. In the case of metal fires, inert agents like dry sand break the chain reaction of metallic combustion. Thus, stopping the chain reaction involves using agents or methods that disrupt the ongoing chemical processes that feed the fire.",

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( November 2016 ) The Fire Triangle . The Fire Triangle or Combustion Triangle or '' Fire Diamond '' are simple models for understanding the necessary ingredients for most fires . The triangle illustrates the three elements a fire needs to ignite : heat , fuel , and an oxidizing agent ( usually oxygen ) . A fire naturally occurs when the elements are present and combined in the right mixture , meaning that fire is actually an event rather than a thing . A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing any one of the elements in the fire triangle . For example , covering a fire with a fire blanket removes the oxygen part of the triangle and can extinguish a fire . In large fires where firefighters are called in , decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is no effective way to make that happen in an extended area . Contents ( hide ) 1 Fire Tetrahedron 2 Oxidizer 3 Extinction of the fire 4 Role of water in fire - fighting 5 Multi-scale fire triangles for wildland fires 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References Fire tetrahedron Not to be confused with NFPA 704 , also called the fire diamond . The fire tetrahedron The fire tetrahedron represents the addition of a component in the chemical chain reaction , to the three already present in the fire triangle . Once a fire has started , the resulting exothermic chain reaction sustains the fire and allows it to continue until or unless at least one of the elements of the fire is blocked . Foam can be used to deny the fire the oxygen it needs . Water can be used to lower the temperature of the fuel below the ignition point or to remove or disperse the fuel . Halon can be used to remove free radicals and create a barrier of inert gas in a direct attack on the chemical reaction responsible for the fire . Combustion is the chemical reaction that feeds a fire more heat and allows it to continue . When the fire involves burning metals like lithium , magnesium , titanium , etc. ( known as a class - D fire ) , it becomes even more important to consider the energy release . The metals react faster with water than with oxygen and thereby more energy is released . Putting water on such a fire results in the fire getting hotter or even exploding . Carbon dioxide extinguishers are ineffective against certain metals such as titanium . Therefore , inert agents ( e.g. dry sand ) must be used to break the chain reaction of metallic combustion . In the same way , as soon as one of the four elements of the tetrahedron is removed , combustion stops . Oxidizer The oxidizer is the other reactant of the chemical reaction . In most cases , it is the ambient air , and in particular one of its components , oxygen ( O ) . By depriving a fire of air , it can be extinguished ; for example , when covering the flame of a small candle with an empty glass , fire stops ; to the contrary , if air is blown over a wood fire with bellows , the fire is activated by the introduction of more air . In certain torches , gaseous oxygen is introduced to improve combustion . Some chemicals , such as fluorine gas , perchlorate salts such as ammonium perchlorate , or chlorine trifluoride , act as oxidisers , sometimes more powerful ones than oxygen itself . A fire based on a reaction with these oxidisers can be very difficult to put out until the oxidiser is exhausted ; that leg of the fire triangle can not be broken by normal means ( i.e. , depriving it of air will not smother it ) . In certain cases such as some explosives , the oxidizer and combustible are the same ( e.g. , nitroglycerin , an unstable molecule that has oxidizing parts in the same molecule as the oxidizeable parts ) . Reaction is initiated by an activating energy , in most cases , it is heat . Several examples include",

AT HOP card AT HOP card Location Auckland Launched October 2012 Manager Thales Group Currency NZD Stored - value Pay as you go Validity Trains Fullers ferries Auckland buses Retailed Online Ticket offices Website http://www.athop.co.nz/ The AT HOP card is an electronic fare payment card that was released in two versions on Auckland public transport services , beginning in May 2011 . The smart card roll out was the first phase in the introduction of an integrated ticketing and fares system ( Auckland Integrated Fares System , or `` AIFS '' ) that was rolled out across the region . The first iteration of the card -- commonly referred to as the `` purple HOP card '' -- was discontinued in 2012 because of issues with the delivery of key technologies . The current card , called the AT HOP card , is in use on all ferry , train and bus services in Auckland . The rollout of the card to all three transport modes was completed in March 2014 . Contents 1 Card operation 2 History 2.1 HOP / Snapper card debacle 2.2 Launch 2.3 Post-launch operation 3 See also 4 References Card operation ( edit ) The AT HOP card is a dark blue credit - card - sized stored - value contactless smartcard that can hold prepaid funds ( called HOP Money ) to pay for fares or for monthly passes for unlimited travel within one or more of three `` transport zones '' . Either facility must be added to the card before travel . Passengers `` tag on '' and `` tag off '' their card on electronic terminals when entering and leaving the transport system in order to validate it or deduct funds . Cards may be `` topped - up '' or monthly passes purchased in the following ways : online , at ticket machines , at ticketing offices , and at selected retail outlets such as bookshops . Top ups may be made by credit or debit card , with the latter three mediums accepting cash payment . The card is designed to reduce the number of transactions at ticket offices and the number of paper tickets . Usage is encouraged by offering cheaper fares than the cash ticket option , although there is an initial once - only fee to purchase the card . Monthly and / or multiple trip travel is only available with the AT HOP card . The card can be used only for fare payments and only on Auckland Transport routes ; it can not be used to pay for refreshments or other items . It can not be used to pay for travel on the Northern Explorer passenger train running between Auckland and Wellington or on inter-city bus services . The AT HOP cards are based on near field communication ( NFC ) with DESFire with support of 3DES and AES , enabling 168 - 128 bit keys . This encryption give card holders the ability to not have their card simply cloned . History ( edit ) In 2008 , the Auckland Regional Transport Authority announced its intentions to develop an integrated ticketing system for the region 's public transport services , called the Auckland Integrated Fares System ( AIFS ) . An initial system developed with a consortium including the French Thales Group and New Zealand - based Snapper Services was announced in 2010 , however subsequent difficulties with the development of technologies for the system saw the termination of Auckland Transport 's agreement with Snapper . The council - controlled organisation confirmed Thales would be contracted with ongoing development of the system across the entirety of the region 's transport network . HOP / Snapper card debacle ( edit ) Snapper Services Ltd , a subsidiary of Infratil , made a joint bid with ANZ , New Zealand Post , Eyede , Unisys and Beca Group for the contract of developing Auckland 's integrated ticketing system . However , the contract was awarded to the Thales Group . Snapper lodged a complaint , later dismissed , questioning the legitimacy of the tender process . The first iteration of the HOP card supplied by Snapper could be used on NZ Bus services only . Snapper announced in late - 2009 that it would begin rolling out its Snapper card onto NZ Bus services ( but no other Auckland bus company or service ) , in spite of the Auckland Regional Transport Authority - Thales integrated ticketing arrangement . In response , the Auckland Regional Transport Authority called the Snapper announcement `` premature '' citing the development of ARTA 's integrated ticketing offering still in development with Thales and confirming that all public transport operators in Auckland , including NZ Bus , would be required to participate in ARTA 's system . Replacing the Auckland Regional Transport Authority in 2010 , Auckland Transport announced it had invited Snapper to work with the council - controlled organisation and Thales on the ticketing system . Auckland Transport confirmed Snapper would develop a contactless smart card and supply buses with ticketing terminals that would support the Thales developed back - end , to be rolled out initially on NZ Bus services and later on ferry and train services in time for the Rugby World Cup 2011 . In April 2011 , Auckland Transport announced the `` HOP card '' , developed by Snapper , with initial rollout on all NZ Bus services . This iteration of the `` HOP card '' was met with initial confusion as to its capabilities and the extent of Auckland Transport 's integration with Snapper and Snapper 's pre-existing infrastructure , which included the ability to make minor transactions with merchants and retailers . Concerns were also raised as to the ability of Auckland 's ticketing system to work with Snapper cards used on Wellington 's transport network and vice versa , with Auckland Transport later instructing NZ Bus drivers not to accept the Wellington implementation of the Snapper card . Auckland Transport subsequently announced in early - 2012 that bus passengers would be required to `` swap out '' their HOP / Snapper cards for a new integrated ticketing card , also called `` HOP '' , as the Snapper offering would not be supported on ferries , trains and on some bus services . Snapper faced difficulties in developing its technology to work with the Thales system , with Thales ' New Zealand chief executive citing that the `` failure of Snapper to deliver a functional bus system that meets the ratified standard has caused delays to project go - live '' . Snapper 's `` failure '' to meet the November 30 deadline imposed by Auckland Transport ultimately led to the organisation severing its relationship with Snapper , citing `` concerns about whether Snapper could modify its system in a suitable timeframe '' . Snapper maintained it was `` wrongly blamed '' for the delays , declaring `` Auckland Transport is being disingenuous with its attempt to position Snapper as the reason that the ( integrated ticketing ) project is delayed . '' Auckland Transport confirmed it had commissioned Thales to provide the new iteration of the `` HOP '' smart card -- called `` AT HOP '' -- and its ticketing terminals , replacing the HOP / Snapper offering on NZ Bus services and introducing the new card onto ferries , trains and all other bus services . Launch ( edit ) AT HOP pilot card The current blue ' AT HOP card ' began rolling out on public transport , starting with the rail network on 28 October 2012 . The rollout for all Auckland bus , train and ferry services was completed by March 2014 . Spark ( then Telecom ) had trialed a ' virtual AT HOP card ' on Android phones with NFC and intended it for release in late 2013 . Post-launch operation ( edit ) A fee of 25 cents for each top up was abolished in July 2014 . In September 2016 , it was reported that the one millionth AT Hop card had been sold , and that 42 per cent of Auckland adults had a card as of June ( 2016 ) .

        "type": "Follow-up",
        "rag_answer": "Besides the integration issues, other differences between the original Snapper HOP card and the later AT HOP card included:\n\n1. Service Coverage:  \n   - The original Snapper HOP card could only be used on NZ Bus services and was not supported on ferries, trains, or bus services operated by companies other than NZ Bus.  \n   - The AT HOP card was designed as a fully integrated ticketing solution across all Auckland public transport modes, including buses, trains, and ferries.\n\n2. Functionality and Compatibility:  \n   - The Snapper card had some additional features such as the ability to make minor transactions with merchants and retailers, which was part of Snapper’s pre-existing infrastructure.  \n   - The AT HOP card was focused on providing a unified transport ticketing system, and it replaced the Snapper offering to provide consistent functionality across all transport services.\n\n3. Card Technology:  \n   - The Snapper HOP card was developed by Snapper with its own ticketing terminals.  \n   - The AT HOP card was developed by Thales, with new ticketing terminals introduced to support the integrated system.\n\n4. Geographic and Inter-System Compatibility:  \n   - There were concerns about the ability of Auckland’s Snapper HOP card to work with Snapper cards used in Wellington’s transport network, with Auckland Transport eventually instructing NZ Bus drivers not to accept the Wellington implementation of the Snapper card.  \n   - The AT HOP card aimed for a more coherent and reliable system within Auckland.\n\n5. Design and Rollout:  \n   - The original Snapper HOP card was announced and rolled out in April 2011.  \n   - The AT HOP card, with a new blue design, began rolling out on the rail network on 28 October 2012 and was fully rolled out across all Auckland public transport by March 2014.\n\nIn summary, the AT HOP card was a comprehensive, integrated ticketing solution designed to serve all modes of public transport in Auckland, while the original Snapper HOP card was limited mainly to NZ Bus services with some additional retail transaction capabilities but lacked full integration across the transport network.",

    "document": "Elephant in the room - wikipedia Elephant in the room For other uses , see Elephant in the room ( disambiguation ) . The Elephant in the Room , Banksy exhibition , 2006 Barely Legal show , Los Angeles ( The elephant is Tai ) Elephant in the room is an English - language metaphorical idiom for an obvious problem or risk that no one wants to discuss . It is based on the idea / thought that something as conspicuous as an elephant can appear to be overlooked in codified social interactions , and that the sociology / psychology of repression also operates on the macro scale . Contents ( hide ) 1 Origins 2 Usage 2.1 Similar 3 See also 4 Notes 5 References 6 External links Origins ( edit ) In 1814 , Ivan Andreevich Krylov ( 1769 -- 1844 ) , poet and fabulist , wrote a fable entitled `` The Inquisitive Man '' which tells of a man who goes to a museum and notices all sorts of tiny things , but fails to notice an elephant . The phrase became proverbial . Fyodor Dostoevsky in his novel ' Demons ' wrote , ' Belinsky was just like Krylov 's Inquisitive Man , who did n't notice the elephant in the museum ... ' The Oxford English Dictionary gives the first recorded use of the phrase , as a simile , in The New York Times on June 20 , 1959 : `` Financing schools has become a problem about equal to having an elephant in the living room . It 's so big you just ca n't ignore it . '' This idiomatic expression may have been in general use much earlier than 1959 . For example , the phrase appears 44 years earlier in the pages of a British journal , Journal of Education , in 1915 . The sentence was presented as a trivial illustration of a question British schoolboys would be able to answer , e.g. , `` Is there an elephant in the class - room ? '' The first widely disseminated conceptual reference was a story written by Mark Twain in 1882 , `` The Stolen White Elephant '' , which slyly dissects the inept , far - ranging activities of detectives trying to find an elephant that was right on the spot after all . This may have been the reference in the legal opinion of United States v. Leviton , 193 F. 2d 848 ( 2nd Circuit , 1951 ) , makes reference in its opinion , `` As I have elsewhere observed , it is like the Mark Twain story of the little boy who was told to stand in a corner and not to think of a white elephant . '' A slightly different version of the phrase was used before this , with George Berkeley talking of whether or not there is `` an invisible elephant in the room '' in his debates with scientists . In 1935 , comedian Jimmy Durante starred on Broadway in the Billy Rose Broadway musical Jumbo , in which a police officer stops him while leading a live elephant and asks , `` What are you doing with that elephant ? '' Durante 's reply , `` What elephant ? '' was a regular show - stopper . Durante reprises the piece in the 1962 film version of the play , Billy Rose 's Jumbo . Usage ( edit ) The term refers to a question , problem , solution , or controversial issue which is obvious to everyone who knows about the situation , but which is deliberately ignored because to do otherwise would cause great embarrassment , sadness , or trigger arguments or is simply taboo . The idiom can imply a value judgment that the issue ought to be discussed openly , or it can simply be an acknowledgment that the issue is there and not going to go away by itself . The term is often used to describe an issue that involves a social taboo , such as race , religion , homosexuality , mental illness , or even suicide . It is applicable when a subject is emotionally charged ; and the people who might have spoken up decide that it is probably best avoided . The idiom is commonly used in addiction recovery terminology to describe the reluctance of friends and family of an addicted person to discuss the person 's problem , thus aiding the person 's denial . Especially in reference to alcohol abuse , the idiom is sometimes coupled with that of the pink elephant , q.v. `` the pink elephant in the room . '' The expression has also been used as a metaphorical idiom in Spanish . In 1994 , the 8000 Process was a legal investigation of events surrounding accusations that the campaign of Colombian Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper for President of Colombia was partially funded with drug money from the Cali Cartel . Insisting on his innocence , Samper stated that if drug money had entered the presidential campaign , it had done so `` behind his back '' . Cardinal Pedro Rubiano , a leader of Colombia 's Catholic Church , stated in an interview that not knowing that drug money financed part of the presidential campaign was similar to not noticing `` an elephant entering one 's living room '' . Since then , the events that led to drug money financing the `` Samper for President '' campaign have been referred to as `` The Elephant '' . For some , their first encounter with this phrase comes through the poem of the same name by Terry Kettering . In one edition of Time magazine in 2013 , Chris Christie was labeled as the `` Elephant in the Room '' on the cover page . Similar ( edit ) A variation is the phrase `` elephant in the corner '' which is infrequently used to the same effect . Logician and philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein used an example of a rhinoceros in the room to show the impossibility of proving negative existential statements . `` Mokita '' is a word in the Kilivila language , which is spoken on Kiriwina , the largest of the Trobriand Islands ( near Papua New Guinea ) . It means `` truth we all know but agree not to talk about .

Contents ( hide ) 1 Origins 2 Usage 2.1 Similar 3 See also 4 Notes 5 References 6 External links Origins In 1814 , Ivan Andreevich Krylov ( 1769 -- 1844 ) , poet and fabulist , wrote a fable entitled `` The Inquisitive Man '' which tells of a man who goes to a museum and notices all sorts of tiny things , but fails to notice an elephant . The phrase became proverbial . Fyodor Dostoevsky in his novel ' Demons ' wrote , ' Belinsky was just like Krylov 's Inquisitive Man , who did n't notice the elephant in the museum ... ' The Oxford English Dictionary gives the first recorded use of the phrase , as a simile , in The New York Times on June 20 , 1959 : `` Financing schools has become a problem about equal to having an elephant in the living room . It 's so big you just ca n't ignore it . '' This idiomatic expression may have been in general use much earlier than 1959 . For example , the phrase appears 44 years earlier in the pages of a British journal , Journal of Education , in 1915 . The sentence was presented as a trivial illustration of a question British schoolboys would be able to answer , e.g. , `` Is there an elephant in the class - room ? '' The first widely disseminated conceptual reference was a story written by Mark Twain in 1882 , `` The Stolen White Elephant '' , which slyly dissects the inept , far - ranging activities of detectives trying to find an elephant that was right on the spot after all . This may have been the reference in the legal opinion of United States v. Leviton , 193 F. 2d 848 ( 2nd Circuit , 1951 ) , makes reference in its opinion , `` As I have elsewhere observed , it is like the Mark Twain story of the little boy who was told to stand in a corner and not to think of a white elephant . '' A slightly different version of the phrase was used before this , with George Berkeley talking of whether or not there is `` an invisible elephant in the room '' in his debates with scientists . In 1935 , comedian Jimmy Durante starred on Broadway in the Billy Rose Broadway musical Jumbo , in which a police officer stops him while leading a live elephant and asks , `` What are you doing with that elephant ? '' Durante 's reply , `` What elephant ? '' was a regular show - stopper . Durante reprises the piece in the 1962 film version of the play , Billy Rose 's Jumbo . Usage The term refers to a question , problem , solution , or controversial issue which is obvious to everyone who knows about the situation , but which is deliberately ignored because to do otherwise would cause great embarrassment , sadness , or trigger arguments or is simply taboo . The idiom can imply a value judgment that the issue ought to be discussed openly , or it can simply be an acknowledgment that the issue is there and not going to go away by itself . The term is often used to describe an issue that involves a social taboo , such as race , religion , homosexuality , mental illness , or even suicide . It is applicable when a subject is emotionally charged ; and the people who might have spoken up decide that it is probably best avoided . The idiom is commonly used in addiction recovery terminology to describe the reluctance of friends and family of an addicted person to discuss the person 's problem , thus aiding the person 's denial . Especially in reference to alcohol abuse , the idiom is sometimes coupled with that of the pink elephant , q.v. `` the pink elephant in",

'' The expression has also been used as a metaphorical idiom in Spanish . In 1994 , the 8000 Process was a legal investigation of events surrounding accusations that the campaign of Colombian Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper for President of Colombia was partially funded with drug money from the Cali Cartel . Insisting on his innocence , Samper stated that if drug money had entered the presidential campaign , it had done so `` behind his back '' . Cardinal Pedro Rubiano , a leader of Colombia 's Catholic Church , stated in an interview that not knowing that drug money financed part of the presidential campaign was similar to not noticing `` an elephant entering one 's living room '' . Since then , the events that led to drug money financing the `` Samper for President '' campaign have been referred to as `` The Elephant '' . For some , their first encounter with this phrase comes through the poem of the same name by Terry Kettering . In one edition of Time magazine in 2013 , Chris Christie was labeled as the `` Elephant in the Room '' on the cover page . Similar A variation is the phrase `` elephant in the corner '' which is infrequently used to the same effect . Logician and philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein used an example of a rhinoceros in the room to show the impossibility of proving negative existential statements . `` Mokita '' is a word in the Kilivila language , which is spoken on Kiriwina , the largest of the Trobriand Islands ( near Papua New Guinea ) . It means `` truth we all know but agree not to talk about .

In addition , ACFA recognizes Russian Shorthairs in white , black , and blue . Domestic cat ( Felis catus ) The Russian Blue is a cat breed that comes in colors varying from a light shimmering silver to a darker , slate grey . They develop close bonds with their owners and are sought out as pets due to their personalities , beauty and coat . It is their short , dense coat which has been the hallmark of the Russian breed for more than a century . The dense coat stands out from the body and one can draw patterns in the coat that will stay until one smoothes them out again . They are also considered to be hypoallergenic . Contents ( hide ) 1 Origin 2 Physical characteristics 3 Behavioral characteristics 4 Growth and maturity 5 Allergies 6 In popular culture 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Origin ( edit ) The Russian Blue is a naturally occurring breed that may have originated in the port of Arkhangel'sk in Russia . They are also sometimes called Archangel Blues . It is believed that sailors took Russian Blues from the Archangel Isles to Great Britain and Northern Europe in the 1860s . The first recorded appearance outside of Russia was in 1875 at The Crystal Palace in England as the Archangel Cat . The Russian Blue competed in a class including all other blue cats until 1912 , when it was given its own class . The breed was developed mainly in England and Scandinavia until after World War II . Right after the war , a lack of numbers of Russian Blues led to cross breeding with the Siamese . Although Russian Blues were in the United States before the war , it was not until the post-war period that American breeders created the modern Russian Blue that is seen in the United States today . This was done by combining the bloodlines of both the Scandinavian and British Russian Blues . The Siamese traits have now largely been bred out . The short hair and slate - gray / blue color is often seen in mixed - breed cats , which can affect breeders and showers due to mislabeling a cat as a Russian Blue . Russian Blues are plush short - haired , shimmering pale blue - gray cats with emerald green eyes . Guard hairs are distinctly silver - tipped giving the cat a silvery sheen or lustrous appearance . They have been used on a limited basis to create other breeds such as the Havana Brown or alter existing breeds such as the Nebelung . They are being used in Italy as a way to make Oriental Shorthairs healthier and more robust called RUS4OSH in FIFe . Russian Whites and Russian Blacks were created from crosses with domestic white cats which were allegedly imported from Russia . The first line was developed by Frances McLeod ( Arctic ) in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and the second line produced by Dick and Mavis Jones ( Myemgay ) in Australia in the 1970s . By the late 1970s , the Russian White and Russian Black colors were accepted by cat fanciers in Australia as well as in South Africa and now also in the United Kingdom as Russian cats ( in different classes ) . However , the Cat Fanciers ' Association and FIFe does not recognize any variation of the Russian Blue . Physical characteristics ( edit ) 4 -- 5 month - old Russian Blue kittens 2 month - old CFA Russian Blue The Russian Blue has bright green eyes , pinkish lavender or mauve paws , two layers of short thick fur , and a blue - grey coat . The color is a bluish - gray that is the dilute expression of the black gene . However , as dilute genes are recessive ( `` d '' ) and each parent will have a set of two recessive genes ( `` dd '' ) two non-CPC Russian Blues will always produce a blue cat . Due to the breeding with Siamese after World War II , there are colorpoint genes floating around . If two carriers are bred together , then they will produce a litter of mixed colors -- solid blue or white with blue like a Siamese . People call these CPC cats `` colorpoint '' , `` whites '' or `` pointed '' Russians . In most registries , one can not register , breed or show a colorpoint Russian . The coat is known as a `` double coat '' , with the undercoat being soft , downy and equal in length to the guard hairs , which are an even blue with silver tips . However , the tail may have a few very dull , almost unnoticeable stripes . The coat is described as thick , plush and soft to the touch . The feeling is softer than the softest silk . The silver tips give the coat a shimmering appearance . Its eyes are almost always a dark and vivid green . Any white patches of fur or yellow eyes in adulthood are seen as flaws in show cats . Russian Blues should not be confused with British Blues ( which are not a distinct breed , but rather a British Shorthair with a blue coat as the British Shorthair breed itself comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns ) , nor the Chartreux or Korat which are two other naturally occurring breeds of blue cats , although they have similar traits . Behavioral characteristics ( edit ) A Russian Blue male Russian Blue 's green eyes The Russian Blue is a curious and tranquil animal . They are known for their friendliness and intelligence and are somewhat reserved . They have been known to play fetch , open doors and are sensitive to human emotions . They enjoy playing with a variety of toys and develop loyal bonds to their loved ones and other family pets . They are generally considered to be a quiet breed but there are always exceptions . They are clean animals that are normally reserved around strangers , unless they are brought up in an active household . Many Russian Blues have been trained to do tricks . They can also be fierce hunters , often catching rodents , birds , rabbits , small mammals , or reptiles . Russian Blue kittens are energetic and require adequate playmates or toys as they can become mischievous if bored . They have exceptional athleticism and rival even Abyssinians for their ability to leap and climb . Slow to mature , Russian Blues retain many of their adolescent traits both good and otherwise until they are 3 -- 4 years old and even much older Blues can be easily enticed into play by their owners . Russian Blues are also as mentioned above highly intelligent , they have an excellent memory and will learn the hiding place of favourite toys ( e.g. laser pointers ) and lead their owners to them when they want a game . They also have a keen ability to remember favourite visitors and will race to greet familiar faces even if quite some time has passed between visits -- a radical departure from their normally very reserved behaviour around unfamiliar people . Growth and maturity ( edit ) Russian Blues have a life expectancy of around 10 -- 20 years , but some have even lived up to a maximum of 25 years and have few health problems as they tend to have little to no genetic problems and are not prone to illness . They are small to moderate - sized cats with an average weight of 2.27 to 5.45 kg ( 5.0 to 12.0 lb ) when full grown . Males will typically be larger than females . Their gestation period is approximately 64 days . Allergies ( edit ) See also : Allergy to cats § Hypoallergenic cats Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Russian Blue may be better tolerated by individuals with mild to moderate allergies . There is speculation that the Russian Blue produces less glycoprotein Fel d 1 , one source of cat allergies . The thicker coat may also trap more of the allergens closer to the cat 's skin . Glycoprotein is one source of cat allergies , but this does not mean they are suitable to be homed with people allergic to cats as they will still cause the allergy to be affected , only to a lesser degree for short periods of time . In popular culture ( edit ) One of the most famous cartoon cats , Tom from Tom and Jerry , is supposed to resemble a Russian Blue . Felicity , a character in the novel and film Felidae , was a Russian Blue . A Russian Blue kitten is a trained assassin in the Cats & Dogs film . According to audio commentary on the DVD , several kittens were used due to the kittens growing faster than the filming schedule . Eben and Snooch are Russian Blues in the comic Two Lumps . The Nyan Cat meme was inspired by creator Chris Torres ' Russian Blue , Marty . Marty died in 2012 from feline infectious peritonitis . In the Warriors series , Bluestar is a Russian Blue cat . See also ( edit ) Russian White , Black and Tabby Nebelung , a moderately - long haired breed which used the Russian Blue as an outcross . References ( edit ) ^ Jump up to : `` Russian Blue '' . Breed Profiles . The Cat Fanciers ' Association . Retrieved 11 October 2013 . Many believe the Russian Blue is a natural breed originating from the Archangel Isles in northern Russia , where the long winters developed a cat with a dense , plush coat . Rumors also abound that the Russian Blue breed descended from the cats kept by the Russian Czars , which was rumoured to hunt the brown bear . Assuming the Russian Blue did migrate from northern Russia , it was likely via ship to Great Britain and northern Europe in the mid 1860s . Jump up ^ Alderton , David ( 1992 ) .

The breed originated in the port of Arkhangel'sk in Russia and is also called Archangel Blue. They have bright green eyes, pinkish lavender or mauve paws, and a double coat. Some believe they may be better tolerated by people with mild allergies.",

        "rag_answer": "Russian Blue cats are a natural breed believed to originate from the Archangel Isles in northern Russia, where the long winters led to the development of a dense, plush coat. There are rumors that the breed descended from cats kept by the Russian Czars and that these cats were reputed to hunt brown bears. The breed likely migrated from northern Russia to Great Britain and northern Europe in the mid-1860s via ship.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that Russian Blues may be better tolerated by individuals with mild to moderate allergies. This may be due to the speculation that Russian Blues produce less glycoprotein Fel d 1, a common cause of cat allergies, and their thicker coat might trap more allergens close to the skin. However, this does not mean they are suitable for all allergy sufferers, as they can still cause allergic reactions, just potentially to a lesser degree for short periods.\n\nIn popular culture, Russian Blue cats are notable as the inspiration for Tom from the cartoon Tom and Jerry, and various other fictional cats such as Felicity in the novel and film Felidae, a trained assassin kitten in the Cats & Dogs film, and characters in comics and the Warriors book series. The Nyan Cat meme was also inspired by a Russian Blue named Marty.\n\nThe Russian Blue is related to other breeds such as the Russian White, Russian Black, and the Nebelung, which is a moderately long-haired breed derived using Russian Blue cats as outcrosses.\n\nReferences suggest the breed has a life expectancy discussed on various cat enthusiast websites, and it has a rich history and distinct characteristics appreciated by cat lovers.",

        "rag_answer": "Yes, there are some special considerations for the care of Russian Blue cats:\n\n1. **Play and Exercise**: Russian Blue kittens and cats are energetic and highly athletic. They require adequate playtime, toys, or playmates to keep them engaged and prevent boredom or mischievous behavior. They are known for their ability to leap and climb, so providing climbing structures or safe spaces to explore is beneficial.\n\n2. **Mental Stimulation**: They are highly intelligent and enjoy interactive play, such as fetch or learning tricks. Providing mental stimulation through toys, games, and training can help keep them happy.\n\n3. **Socialization**: Russian Blues tend to be reserved around strangers but can be affectionate and loyal to their family members. Early socialization in an active household can help them become more comfortable with unfamiliar people.\n\n4. **Cleanliness**: They are generally clean animals, so maintaining their grooming and living areas is important.\n\n5. **Health**: Russian Blues tend to have few genetic health issues and are not prone to illness, but regular veterinary check-ups are still recommended to monitor their overall health.\n\n6. **Environment**: Providing a calm and secure environment suits their tranquil and somewhat reserved nature.\n\nBy considering these factors, owners can help ensure that a Russian Blue cat remains healthy, happy, and well-adjusted.",

    "title": "Parens patriae",
    "document": "Parens patriae - wikipedia Parens patriae Jump to : navigation , search Parens patriae is Latin for `` parent of the nation '' ( lit. , `` parent of the fatherland '' ) . In law , it refers to the public policy power of the state to intervene against an abusive or negligent parent , legal guardian , or informal caretaker , and to act as the parent of any child or individual who is in need of protection . For example , some children , incapacitated individuals , and disabled individuals lack parents who are able and willing to render adequate care , thus requiring state intervention . In U.S. litigation , parens patriae can be invoked by the state to create its standing to sue ; the state declares itself to be suing on behalf of its people . For example , the Hart - Scott - Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 ( 15 USC 15c ) , through Section 4C of the Clayton Act , permits state attorneys general to bring parens patriae suits on behalf of those injured by violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act . Contents ( hide ) 1 Discussion 2 Parens patriae in US federal courts 3 See also 4 Further reading 5 References Discussion ( edit ) Parens patriae relates to a notion initially invoked by the King 's Bench in the sixteenth century in cases of non compos mentis adults . The notion dates from at least 1608 , as recorded in Coke 's Report of Calvin 's Case , wherein it is said `` that moral law , honora patrem ... doubtless doth extend to him that is pater patriæ . '' The parens patriae doctrine was gradually applied to children throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , and has since evolved from one granting absolute rights to the sovereign to one more associated with rights and obligations of the state and courts towards children and incapacitated adults . In most jurisdictions , this appears in the principle that makes the protection of the best interests of any child the first and single most important concern of the courts . For example , in any proceedings affecting the validity of a marriage , the children will not be parties in their own right , nor will they be parties to any agreement that the spouses may make . In these proceedings , the courts will often be invited to accept and enforce any agreement between a husband and wife regarding parental responsibility for their children . This will usually be done so long as the agreement is seen to be in the best interests and welfare of the children . Courts are not obliged to invoke the parens patriae doctrine in cases involving children and not all courts , particularly newer courts such as the Australian Family Court ( est 1975 ) , have specific parens patriae jurisdiction . In the United States , some proponents of homeschooling have asserted that the Parens Patriae Doctrine is constrained by a so - called `` Parental Liberty Doctrine . '' In some situations , the parties may have submitted their dispute to formal arbitration proceedings . Such proceedings , whether judicial or quasi-judicial , can not displace the supervisory power of the court in the exercise of its parens patriae function to the child . To the extent that such an award conflicts with the best interests of the child , the courts will treat it as void in respect of the child , even though it might be binding on the parents . The test of the best interests of the child can always be the basis of a challenge by a parent , grandparent , an interested relative , or the child acting through a friend . Thus , for example , the spouses might already have been through a religious form of divorce known as the get before the Beth Din , the Jewish rabbinical court , which included provision for the children . Even though there might appear to be a grant of custody in absolute terms by this court , public policy always requires that it can be reviewed by a secular court and , if the state court is of the view that it is not in the best interests of the child , it will be set aside ( see Stanley G. v. Eileen G. New York Law Journal , 10 - 13 - 94 , P. 22 , Col. 6 , Sup . Ct. , NY Co . ) . Within the EU , the right of the child to be heard in any proceedings is a fundamental right provided in Article 24 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union . The views of the child shall be considered on matters which concern them in accordance with their age and maturity . It also provides that the child 's best interest shall be the primary consideration in all actions relating to children , whether taken by public authorities or private institutions . The same principles apply to individuals whose mental capacity is impaired and who are being abused by carers or other individuals , whether family members or otherwise . Since these individuals can not protect themselves , the courts have an inherent jurisdiction to appoint a guardian ad litem for particular proceedings . In English Law , long - term care is arranged through the Court of Protection . Parens patriae in U.S. federal courts ( edit ) The concept of the parens patriae suit has been greatly expanded in the United States federal courts beyond that which existed in England . In Louisiana v. Texas , the State of Louisiana brought suit to enjoin officials of the State of Texas from so administering the Texas quarantine regulations as to prevent Louisiana merchants from sending goods into Texas . The US Supreme Court recognized that Louisiana was attempting to sue , not because of any particular injury to a particular business of the State , but as parens patriae for all its citizens . While the Court found that parens patriae could not properly be invoked in that case , the propriety and utility of parens patriae suits were clearly recognized , thus setting a precedent . Thus , in a series of cases after Louisiana v. Texas the Supreme Court followed that precedent to allow states to sue as parens patriae : Missouri v. Illinois , 180 U.S. 208 ( 1901 ) ( holding that Missouri was permitted to sue Illinois and a Chicago sanitation district on behalf of Missouri citizens to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the Mississippi River ) ; Kansas v. Colorado , 206 U.S. 46 ( 1907 ) ( holding that Kansas was permitted to sue as parens patriae to enjoin the diversion of water from an interstate stream ) ; Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co. , 206 U.S. 230 ( 1907 ) ( holding that Georgia was entitled to sue to enjoin fumes from a copper plant across the state border from injuring land in five Georgia counties ) ; New York v. New Jersey , 256 U.S. 296 ( 1921 ) ( holding that New York could sue to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the New York harbor ) ; Pennsylvania v. West Virginia , 262 U.S. 553 ( 1923 ) ( holding that Pennsylvania might sue to enjoin restraints on the commercial flow of natural gas ) ; North Dakota v. Minnesota , 263 U.S. 365 ( 1923 ) ( holding that Minnesota could sue to enjoin changes in drainage which increase the flow of water in an interstate stream ) . The Supreme Court recognized a different kind of paren patriae suit in Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co . While the earlier cases were common - law actions to prevent or repair harm to a state 's `` quasi-sovereign '' interests . Georgia now sought relief under the federal antitrust statute , alleging that 20 railroads had conspired to restrain trade and to fix prices in a manner that would favor shippers in other States ( particularly Northern States ) to the detriment of Georgia shippers and the state 's economy . The Court upheld Georgia 's claim as parens patriae with respect to injunctive relief , but did not consider whether the antitrust laws also authorized damages for an injury to the State 's economy , because the ICC 's approval of the challenged rates barred any damage recovery . Then , three decades later , in Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. , the Court considered a generally similar damages action Hawaii brought under the antitrust laws for damages to its general economy resulting from a price fix by four oil companies . The Court held that the state could sue as parens patriae only for injunctive relief and not for damages . Its citizens would have to sue individually for damages . In Massachusetts v. EPA , a group of states ( mostly coastal states ) sought to sue the EPA to require it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions because they were causing global warming and rising sea levels . `` These rising seas have already begun to swallow Massachusetts ' coastal land . '' The Court stated : In sum -- at least according to petitioners ' uncontested affidavits -- the rise in sea levels associated with global warming has already harmed and will continue to harm Massachusetts . The risk of catastrophic harm , though remote , is nevertheless real . That risk would be reduced to some extent if petitioners received the relief they seek . Therefore , states such as Massachusetts had standing as parens patriae to sue EPA to seeks to require it to regulate to protect their coastlines . The Court held that EPA would have to consider the matter and give a reasoned explanation of whatever its decision on the merits would be . In Pennsylvania v. Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors , Inc. , the Fourth Circuit held that several state attorney generals were proper parens patriae plaintiffs to sue a group of car dealers for price fixing , in order to recover damages for their citizen injured by overcharges . The court held that because plaintiffs were authorized to pursue antitrust litigation against defendants on behalf of their states ' natural - person residents under both 15 U.S.C. § § 15c - 15h and state laws and constitutions , they could sue on behalf of their citizens .

            "page_content": "Parens patriae - wikipedia Parens patriae Jump to : navigation , search Parens patriae is Latin for `` parent of the nation '' ( lit. , `` parent of the fatherland '' ) . In law , it refers to the public policy power of the state to intervene against an abusive or negligent parent , legal guardian , or informal caretaker , and to act as the parent of any child or individual who is in need of protection . For example , some children , incapacitated individuals , and disabled individuals lack parents who are able and willing to render adequate care , thus requiring state intervention . In U.S. litigation , parens patriae can be invoked by the state to create its standing to sue ; the state declares itself to be suing on behalf of its people . For example , the Hart - Scott - Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 ( 15 USC 15c ) , through Section 4C of the Clayton Act , permits state attorneys general to bring parens patriae suits on behalf of those injured by violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act . Contents ( hide ) 1 Discussion 2 Parens patriae in US federal courts 3 See also 4 Further reading 5 References Discussion Parens patriae relates to a notion initially invoked by the King 's Bench in the sixteenth century in cases of non compos mentis adults . The notion dates from at least 1608 , as recorded in Coke 's Report of Calvin 's Case , wherein it is said `` that moral law , honora patrem ... doubtless doth extend to him that is pater patriæ . '' The parens patriae doctrine was gradually applied to children throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , and has since evolved from one granting absolute rights to the sovereign to one more associated with rights and obligations of the state and courts towards children and incapacitated adults . In most jurisdictions , this appears in the principle that makes the protection of the best interests of any child the first and single most important concern of the courts . For example , in any proceedings affecting the validity of a marriage , the children will not be parties in their own right , nor will they be parties to any agreement that the spouses may make . In these proceedings , the courts will often be invited to accept and enforce any agreement between a husband and wife regarding parental responsibility for their children . This will usually be done so long as the agreement is seen to be in the best interests and welfare of the children . Courts are not obliged to invoke the parens patriae doctrine in cases involving children and not all courts , particularly newer courts such as the Australian Family Court ( est 1975 ) , have specific parens patriae jurisdiction . In the United States , some proponents of homeschooling have asserted that the Parens Patriae Doctrine is constrained by a so - called `` Parental Liberty Doctrine . '' In some situations , the parties may have submitted their dispute to formal arbitration proceedings . Such proceedings , whether judicial or quasi-judicial , can not displace the supervisory power of the court in the exercise of its parens patriae function to the child . To the extent that such an award conflicts with the best interests of the child , the courts will treat it as void in respect of the child , even though it might be binding on the parents . The test of the best interests of the child can always be the basis of a challenge by a parent , grandparent , an interested relative , or the child acting through a friend . Thus , for example , the spouses might already have been through a religious form of divorce known as the get before the Beth Din , the Jewish rabbinical court , which included provision for the children . Even though there might appear to be a grant of custody in absolute terms by this court , public policy always requires that it can be reviewed by a secular court and , if the state court is of the view that it is not in the best interests of the child , it will be set aside ( see Stanley G. v.

        "question": "Given the limitations on the types of damages a state can seek in a 'parens patriae' suit, is it accurate to say that injunctive relief is generally permissible while the pursuit of monetary damages is subject to greater restrictions and complexities?",
        "answer": "The Court held that the state could sue as parens patriae only for injunctive relief and not for damages . Its citizens would have to sue individually for damages.",
        "type": "Clarification",
        "rag_answer": "Yes, that is correct. In parens patriae suits, courts generally allow states to seek injunctive relief to protect their quasi-sovereign interests. However, the recovery of monetary damages is more complex and may be limited depending on the specific legal context and regulatory approvals involved. For example, in Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., the Supreme Court upheld injunctive relief but did not permit damages due to the Interstate Commerce Commission's approval of the challenged rates, which barred damage recovery. Thus, while injunctive relief is commonly granted, monetary damages require a more nuanced analysis and are not always available.",

New York Law Journal , 10 - 13 - 94 , P. 22 , Col. 6 , Sup . Ct. , NY Co . ) . Within the EU , the right of the child to be heard in any proceedings is a fundamental right provided in Article 24 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union . The views of the child shall be considered on matters which concern them in accordance with their age and maturity . It also provides that the child 's best interest shall be the primary consideration in all actions relating to children , whether taken by public authorities or private institutions . The same principles apply to individuals whose mental capacity is impaired and who are being abused by carers or other individuals , whether family members or otherwise . Since these individuals can not protect themselves , the courts have an inherent jurisdiction to appoint a guardian ad litem for particular proceedings . In English Law , long - term care is arranged through the Court of Protection . Parens patriae in U.S. federal courts The concept of the parens patriae suit has been greatly expanded in the United States federal courts beyond that which existed in England . In Louisiana v. Texas , the State of Louisiana brought suit to enjoin officials of the State of Texas from so administering the Texas quarantine regulations as to prevent Louisiana merchants from sending goods into Texas . The US Supreme Court recognized that Louisiana was attempting to sue , not because of any particular injury to a particular business of the State , but as parens patriae for all its citizens . While the Court found that parens patriae could not properly be invoked in that case , the propriety and utility of parens patriae suits were clearly recognized , thus setting a precedent . Thus , in a series of cases after Louisiana v. Texas the Supreme Court followed that precedent to allow states to sue as parens patriae : Missouri v. Illinois , 180 U.S. 208 ( 1901 ) ( holding that Missouri was permitted to sue Illinois and a Chicago sanitation district on behalf of Missouri citizens to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the Mississippi River ) ; Kansas v. Colorado , 206 U.S. 46 ( 1907 ) ( holding that Kansas was permitted to sue as parens patriae to enjoin the diversion of water from an interstate stream ) ; Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co. , 206 U.S. 230 ( 1907 ) ( holding that Georgia was entitled to sue to enjoin fumes from a copper plant across the state border from injuring land in five Georgia counties ) ; New York v. New Jersey , 256 U.S. 296 ( 1921 ) ( holding that New York could sue to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the New York harbor ) ; Pennsylvania v. West Virginia , 262 U.S. 553 ( 1923 ) ( holding that Pennsylvania might sue to enjoin restraints on the commercial flow of natural gas ) ; North Dakota v. Minnesota , 263 U.S. 365 ( 1923 ) ( holding that Minnesota could sue to enjoin changes in drainage which increase the flow of water in an interstate stream ) .

    "document": "Nimbostratus cloud - wikipedia Nimbostratus cloud Jump to : navigation , search Nimbostratus cloud Nimbostratus with fractus Abbreviation Ns Symbol Genus Nimbostratus ( rain , layered ) Species none Variety none Altitude below 3,000 m ( below 10,000 ft ) Appearance Dark , widespread , formless layer Precipitation cloud ? Yes , but may be virga Nimbostratus is a stratiform genus formerly classified as `` Family C '' low - level , but now considered by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) to be a middle - or multi-level stratus type. . Although it is usually a low - based cloud , it actually forms most commonly in the middle level of the troposphere and then spreads vertically into the low and high levels . This change in classification would once have made it a `` Family D '' cloud , but this style of letter - based family nomenclature was discontinued by the WMO in 1956 . Nimbostratus usually produces precipitation over a wide area . Nimbo - is from the Latin word nimbus , which denotes precipitation . Downward - growing nimbostratus can have the same vertical extent as most large upward - growing cumulus , but its horizontal extent tends to be even greater . This sometimes leads to the exclusion of nimbostratus from the group of vertical clouds by some independent meteorologists and educators . Classifications that follow this approach usually show nimbostratus as low - level based on its normal base height range . Contents ( hide ) 1 Appearance 2 Formation 3 Forecast 4 Origin of name 5 Subtypes and derivative types 6 Relation to other clouds 7 References 8 External links Appearance ( edit ) Nimbostratus has a diffuse cloud base generally found anywhere from near surface in the low levels to about 3,000 m ( 9,800 ft ) in the middle level of the troposphere . Although usually dark at its base , it often appears illuminated from within to a surface observer . Nimbostratus usually has a thickness of about 2000 to 4000 m . Though found worldwide , nimbostratus occurs more commonly in the middle latitudes . It is coded C 2 on the SYNOP report . Formation ( edit ) Nimbostratus occurs along a warm front or occluded front where the slowly rising warm air mass creates nimbostratus along with shallower stratus clouds producing less rain , these clouds being preceded by higher - level clouds such as cirrostratus and altostratus . Often , when an altostratus cloud thickens and descends into lower altitudes , it will become nimbostratus . Nimbostratus , unlike cumulonimbus , is not associated with thunderstorms , however at an unusually unstable warm front caused as a result of the advancing warm air being hot , humid and unstable , cumulonimbus clouds may be embedded within the usual nimbostratus . Lightning from an embedded cumulonimbus cloud may interact with the nimbostratus but only in the immediate area around it . In this situation with lightning and rain occurring it would be hard to tell which type of cloud was producing the rain from the ground , however cumulonimbus tend to produce larger droplets and more intense downpours . The occurrence of cumulonimbus and nimbostratus together is uncommon , and usually only nimbostratus is found at a warm front . Forecast ( edit ) Nimbostrati often have very few visual features . Nimbostratus is generally a sign of an approaching warm or occluded front producing steady moderate precipitation , as opposed to the shorter period of typically heavier precipitation released by a cold - frontal cumulonimbus cloud . Precipitation may last for several days , depending on the speed of the frontal system . A nimbostratus virga cloud is the same as normal nimbostratus , but the rain or snow falls as virga which does n't reach the ground . Stratus or stratocumulus usually replace the nimbostratus after the passage of the warm or occluded front . Origin of name ( edit ) Further information : Cloud § History of cloud science and nomenclature Under Luke Howard 's first systematized study of clouds , carried out in France in 1802 , three general cloud forms were established based on appearance and characteristics of formation : cirriform , cumiliform and stratiform . These were further divided into upper and lower types depending on altitude . In addition to these three main types , Howard added two names to designate multiple cloud types joined together : cumulostratus , a blending of cumulus clouds and stratus layers , and nimbus , a complex blending of cirriform , cumuliform , and stratiform clouds with sufficient vertical development to produce significant precipitation . Later , in the 20th Century , an IMC commission for the study of clouds put forward a refined and more restricted definition of the genus nimbus , effectively reclassifying it as a stratiform cloud type . It was then renamed nimbostratus , and published with the new name in the 1932 edition of the International Atlas of Clouds and of States of the Sky . This left cumulonimbus as the only nimbiform type as indicated by its root - name . Subtypes and derivative types ( edit ) Species and varieties : Nimbostratus is very thick , opaque , and featureless , so this genus type is not subdivided into species or varieties . Precipitation - based supplementary features : Nimbostratus is a major precipitation cloud and produces the virga or praecipitatio features . The latter can achieve heavy intensity due to the cloud 's vertical depth . Accessory cloud : Nimbostratus pannus is an accessory cloud of nimbostratus that forms as a ragged layer in precipitation below the main cloud deck. Pannus is coded C 7 . Genitus mother clouds : This genus type can form from cumulus and cumulonimbus . Mutatus mother clouds : Nimbostratus can form due to the complete transformation of altocumulus , altostratus and stratocumulus . Relation to other clouds ( edit ) Multi-level nimbostratus is physically related to other stratiform genus - types by way of being non-convective in nature . However , the other sheet - like clouds usually each occupy only one or two levels at the same time . Stratus clouds are low - level and form from near ground level to 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) at all latitudes . In the middle level are the altostratus clouds that form from 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) to 7,000 metres ( 23,000 ft ) in polar areas , 7,000 metres ( 23,000 ft ) in temperate areas , and 7,600 metres ( 24,900 ft ) in tropical areas . Although altostratus forms mostly in the middle level of the troposphere , strong frontal lift can push it into the lower part of the high - level . The main hight - level stratiform cloud is cirrostratus which is composed of ice crystals that often produce halo effects around the sun . Cirrostratus forms at altitudes of 3,000 to 7,600 metres ( 9,800 to 24,900 ft ) in high latitudes , 5,000 to 12,000 metres ( 16,000 to 39,000 ft ) in temperate latitudes , and 6,100 to 18,000 metres ( 20,000 to 59,100 ft ) in low , tropical latitudes . Of the non-stratiform clouds , cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus are the most closely related to nimbostratus because of their vertical extent and ability to produce moderate to heavy precipitation .

        "rag_answer": "Nimbostratus and cumulonimbus clouds differ primarily in their vertical extent and structure. Nimbostratus clouds are thick, opaque, and featureless stratiform clouds with significant vertical depth but are generally non-convective in nature. They produce steady, often heavy precipitation but lack the strong vertical development seen in cumulonimbus clouds.\n\nIn contrast, cumulonimbus clouds have strong vertical development (convective clouds) and are capable of producing moderate to heavy precipitation, including thunderstorms and severe weather. While nimbostratus can form from transformations of other cloud types and generally appear as extensive, uniform layers, cumulonimbus clouds are more vertically towering and dynamic.\n\nThus, cumulonimbus clouds are more vertically extensive and convective than nimbostratus clouds, which are stratiform and non-convective. Both can produce significant precipitation, but cumulonimbus clouds are associated with more intense weather phenomena such as thunderstorms.",

            "page_content": ": Cloud § History of cloud science and nomenclature Under Luke Howard 's first systematized study of clouds , carried out in France in 1802 , three general cloud forms were established based on appearance and characteristics of formation : cirriform , cumiliform and stratiform . These were further divided into upper and lower types depending on altitude . In addition to these three main types , Howard added two names to designate multiple cloud types joined together : cumulostratus , a blending of cumulus clouds and stratus layers , and nimbus , a complex blending of cirriform , cumuliform , and stratiform clouds with sufficient vertical development to produce significant precipitation . Later , in the 20th Century , an IMC commission for the study of clouds put forward a refined and more restricted definition of the genus nimbus , effectively reclassifying it as a stratiform cloud type . It was then renamed nimbostratus , and published with the new name in the 1932 edition of the International Atlas of Clouds and of States of the Sky . This left cumulonimbus as the only nimbiform type as indicated by its root - name . Subtypes and derivative types Species and varieties : Nimbostratus is very thick , opaque , and featureless , so this genus type is not subdivided into species or varieties . Precipitation - based supplementary features : Nimbostratus is a major precipitation cloud and produces the virga or praecipitatio features . The latter can achieve heavy intensity due to the cloud 's vertical depth . Accessory cloud : Nimbostratus pannus is an accessory cloud of nimbostratus that forms as a ragged layer in precipitation below the main cloud deck. Pannus is coded C 7 . Genitus mother clouds : This genus type can form from cumulus and cumulonimbus . Mutatus mother clouds : Nimbostratus can form due to the complete transformation of altocumulus , altostratus and stratocumulus . Relation to other clouds Multi-level nimbostratus is physically related to other stratiform genus - types by way of being non-convective in nature . However , the other sheet - like clouds usually each occupy only one or two levels at the same time . Stratus clouds are low - level and form from near ground level to 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) at all latitudes . In the middle level are the altostratus clouds that form from 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) to 7,000 metres ( 23,000 ft ) in polar areas , 7,000 metres ( 23,000 ft ) in temperate areas , and 7,600 metres ( 24,900 ft ) in tropical areas . Although altostratus forms mostly in the middle level of the troposphere , strong frontal lift can push it into the lower part of the high - level . The main hight - level stratiform cloud is cirrostratus which is composed of ice crystals that often produce halo effects around the sun . Cirrostratus forms at altitudes of 3,000 to 7,600 metres ( 9,800 to 24,900 ft ) in high latitudes , 5,000 to 12,000 metres ( 16,000 to 39,000 ft ) in temperate latitudes , and 6,100 to 18,000 metres ( 20,000 to 59,100 ft ) in low , tropical latitudes . Of the non-stratiform clouds , cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus are the most closely related to nimbostratus because of their vertical extent and ability to produce moderate to heavy precipitation . The remaining cumuliform ( cumulus ) and stratocumuliform ( stratocumulus , altocumulus , and cirrocumulus ) clouds have the least in common with nimbostratus .

Precipitation - based supplementary features : Nimbostratus is a major precipitation cloud and produces the virga or praecipitatio features . The latter can achieve heavy intensity due to the cloud 's vertical depth . Accessory cloud : Nimbostratus pannus is an accessory cloud of nimbostratus that forms as a ragged layer in precipitation below the main cloud deck. Pannus is coded C 7 . Genitus mother clouds : This genus type can form from cumulus and cumulonimbus . Mutatus mother clouds : Nimbostratus can form due to the complete transformation of altocumulus , altostratus and stratocumulus . Relation to other clouds Multi-level nimbostratus is physically related to other stratiform genus - types by way of being non-convective in nature . However , the other sheet - like clouds usually each occupy only one or two levels at the same time . Stratus clouds are low - level and form from near ground level to 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) at all latitudes . In the middle level are the altostratus clouds that form from 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) to 7,000 metres ( 23,000 ft ) in polar areas , 7,000 metres ( 23,000 ft ) in temperate areas , and 7,600 metres ( 24,900 ft ) in tropical areas . Although altostratus forms mostly in the middle level of the troposphere , strong frontal lift can push it into the lower part of the high - level . The main hight - level stratiform cloud is cirrostratus which is composed of ice crystals that often produce halo effects around the sun . Cirrostratus forms at altitudes of 3,000 to 7,600 metres ( 9,800 to 24,900 ft ) in high latitudes , 5,000 to 12,000 metres ( 16,000 to 39,000 ft ) in temperate latitudes , and 6,100 to 18,000 metres ( 20,000 to 59,100 ft ) in low , tropical latitudes . Of the non-stratiform clouds , cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus are the most closely related to nimbostratus because of their vertical extent and ability to produce moderate to heavy precipitation . The remaining cumuliform ( cumulus ) and stratocumuliform ( stratocumulus , altocumulus , and cirrocumulus ) clouds have the least in common with nimbostratus .

Contents ( hide ) 1 Stages of interphase 2 Interphase within sequences of cellular processes 2.1 Interphase and the cell cycle 2.2 Interphase and other cellular processes 3 See also 4 References Stages of interphase ( edit ) There are three stages of cellular interphase , with each phase ending when a cellular checkpoint checks the accuracy of the stage 's completion before proceeding to the next . The stages of interphase are : G ( Gap 1 ) , in which the cell grows and functions normally . During this time , a high amount of protein synthesis occurs and the cell grows ( to about double its original size ) -- more organelles are produced and the volume of the cytoplasm increases . If the cell is not to divide again , it will enter G . Synthesis ( S ) , in which the cell duplicates its DNA ( via semiconservative replication ) . G ( Gap 2 ) , in which the cell resumes its growth in preparation for division . The mitochondria divide and the cell continues to grow until mitosis begins . In plants , chloroplasts also divide during G2 . In addition , some cells that do not divide often or ever , enter a stage called G ( Gap zero ) , which is either a stage separate from interphase or an extended G . The duration of time spent in interphase and in each stage of interphase is variable and depends on both the type of cell and the species of organism it belongs to . Most cells of adult mammals spend about 20 hours in interphase ; this accounts for about 90 % of the total time involved in cell division . Interphase includes G1 , S , and G2 phases . Mitosis and cytokinesis , however , are separate from interphase . Interphase within sequences of cellular processes ( edit ) Interphase and the cell cycle ( edit ) When G is completed , the cell enters a relatively brief period of nuclear and cellular division , composed of mitosis and cytokinesis , respectively . After the successful completion of mitosis and cytokinesis , both resulting daughter cells re-enter G of interphase . In the cell cycle , interphase is preceded by telophase and cytokinesis of the M phase . In alternative fashion , interphase is sometimes interrupted by G phase , which , in some circumstances , may then end and be followed by the remaining stages of interphase . After the successful completion of the G checkpoint , the final checkpoint in interphase , the cell proceeds to prophase , or in plants to preprophase , which is the first stage of mitosis . G phase is viewed as either an extended G phase where the cell is neither dividing nor preparing to divide and or as a distinct quiescent stage which occurs outside of the cell cycle .

Specifically, these checkpoints verify that critical processes such as DNA replication have been completed successfully and that the cell is in proper condition to continue. For example, the G1 checkpoint (also known as the restriction point) assesses whether the cell has adequate size, nutrients, and DNA integrity before allowing entry into the S phase for DNA replication. Similarly, the final checkpoint in interphase ensures all preparations are complete before the cell enters mitosis (prophase). These checkpoints help prevent the division of damaged or unprepared cells, thereby maintaining genomic stability and proper cell function.",

        "question": "Given that interphase can be followed by either mitosis or meiosis, what is the key difference between mitosis and meiosis in terms of their purpose or outcome?",
        "answer": "Somatic cells, or normal diploid cells of the body, go through mitosis in order to reproduce themselves through cell division , whereas diploid germ cells ( i.e. , primary spermatocytes and primary oocytes ) go through meiosis in order to create haploid gametes ( i.e. , sperm and ova ) for the purpose of sexual reproduction .",
        "type": "Follow-up",
        "rag_answer": "The provided context primarily describes mitosis and the cell cycle but does not include specific information about meiosis or the differences between mitosis and meiosis. \n\nBased on general biological knowledge:\n\n- Mitosis is a process of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the original cell (diploid in most cases). It is involved in growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in eukaryotic cells.\n\n- Meiosis, on the other hand, is a specialized form of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, producing four genetically diverse haploid cells (gametes). It involves two successive divisions (meiosis I and meiosis II) and is fundamental for sexual reproduction.\n\nThe key differences are:\n1. Number of divisions: Mitosis involves one division; meiosis involves two.\n2. Number of daughter cells: Mitosis produces two; meiosis produces four.\n3. Genetic variation: Mitosis produces identical cells; meiosis produces genetically varied cells due to crossing over and independent assortment.\n4. Chromosome number: Mitosis maintains the original number; meiosis halves it.\n\nSince the context does not contain this information, I cannot provide a detailed comparison based solely on it.",

            "page_content": "from G to S phase . Passage through the G check point commits the cell to division . S phase ( DNA replication ) The ensuing S phase starts when DNA synthesis commences ; when it is complete , all of the chromosomes have been replicated , i.e. , each chromosome has two ( sister ) chromatids . Thus , during this phase , the amount of DNA in the cell has effectively doubled , though the ploidy of the cell remains the same . Rates of RNA transcription and protein synthesis are very low during this phase . An exception to this is histone production , most of which occurs during the S phase . G phase ( growth ) G2 phase occurs after DNA replication and is a period of protein synthesis and rapid cell growth to prepare the cell for mitosis . During this phase microtubules begin to reorganize to form a spindle . Mitotic phase ( chromosome separation ) Main article : Mitosis The relatively brief M phase consists of nuclear division ( karyokinesis ) . It is a relatively short period of the cell cycle . M phase is complex and highly regulated . The sequence of events is divided into phases , corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next . These phases are sequentially known as : prophase , metaphase , anaphase , telophase Mitosis is the process by which a eukaryotic cell separates the chromosomes in its cell nucleus into two identical sets in two nuclei . During the process of mitosis the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell . Mitosis occurs exclusively in eukaryotic cells , but occurs in different ways in different species . For example , animals undergo an `` open '' mitosis , where the nuclear envelope breaks down before the chromosomes separate , while fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( yeast ) undergo a `` closed '' mitosis , where chromosomes divide within an intact cell nucleus . Prokaryotic cells , which lack a nucleus , divide by a process called binary fission . Cytokinesis phase ( separation of all cell components ) Main article : Cytokinesis Mitosis is immediately followed by cytokinesis , which divides the nuclei , cytoplasm , organelles and cell membrane into two cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components . Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells , genetically identical to each other and to their parent cell . This accounts for approximately 10 % of the cell cycle . Because cytokinesis usually occurs in conjunction with mitosis , `` mitosis '' is often used interchangeably with `` M phase '' . However , there are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately , forming single cells with multiple nuclei in a process called endoreplication . This occurs most notably among the fungi and slime moulds , but is found in various groups . Even in animals , cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently , for instance during certain stages of fruit fly embryonic development . Errors in mitosis can either kill a cell through apoptosis or cause mutations that may lead to cancer . The process of mitosis is complex and highly regulated . The sequence of events is divided into phases , corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next . These stages are prophase , prometaphase , metaphase , anaphase and telophase . During the process of mitosis the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell . The cell then divides in cytokinesis , to produce two identical daughter cells . Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle Regulation of the cell cycle involves processes crucial to the survival of a cell , including the detection and repair of genetic damage as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division . The molecular events that control the cell cycle are ordered and directional ; that is , each process",

Typical fynbos foliage is ericoid rather than fine . The term , in its pre-Afrikaans , Dutch form , fynbosch , was recorded by Noble as being in casual use in the late 19th century . In the early 20th century , John Bews referred to : `` South - Western or Cape Region of Macchia or Fynbosch '' . He said : `` In this well - known region where the rain occurs in winter and the summers are more or less dry , the dominant vegetation is of a sclerophyllous type and there is little or no natural grassland , though there are many grasses ... '' He also refers to a high degree of endemism in the grasses in that region . Elsewhere he speaks of the term as `` ... applied by the inhabitants of the Cape to any sort of small woodland growth that does not include timber trees '' ; in the current vernacular , this still is the effective sense of the word . However , in the technical , ecological sense , the constraints are more demanding . In the latter half of the 20th century , `` fynbos '' gained currency as the term for the `` distinctive vegetation of the southwestern Cape '' . Cape floral kingdom ( edit ) The Cape Floral Kingdom ( Capensis ) is one of only 6 floristic kingdoms in the world . It is also the smallest and richest per unit of area . Main article : Cape Floristic Region Fynbos -- which grows in a 100 - to - 200 - km - wide coastal belt stretching from Clanwilliam on the West coast to Port Elizabeth on the Southeast coast -- forms part of the Cape floral kingdom , where it accounts for half of the surface area and 80 % of the plant species . The fynbos in the western regions is richer and more varied than in the eastern regions of South Africa . Of the world 's six floral kingdoms , this is the smallest and richest per unit of area . The Holarctic kingdom , in contrast , incorporates the whole of the Northern Hemisphere north of the tropics . The diversity of fynbos plants is extremely high , with over 9000 species of plants occurring in the area , around 6200 of which are endemic , i.e. growing nowhere else in the world . South Africa 's Western Cape has a level of botanic diversity that exceeds that of the richest tropical rainforest in South America , including the Amazon . Of the Ericas , over 600 occur in the fynbos kingdom , while only two or three dozen have been described in the rest of the world . This is in an area of 46,000 km -- by comparison , the Netherlands , with an area of 33,000 km , has 1400 species , none of them endemic . Table Mountain in Cape Town supports 2200 species , more than the entire United Kingdom . Thus , although the fynbos covers only 6 % of the area of southern Africa , it has half the species on the subcontinent -- and in fact has almost 1 in 5 of all African plant species so far described . Five main river systems traverse the Cape floral kingdom : the Oliphants River of the Western Cape ; the Berg River which drains the West Coast Forelands plain stretching from the Cape Flats to the Olifants ; the Breede , which is the largest river on the Cape ; the Olifants River ( Southern Cape ) ; Gourits and the Groot Rivers which drain the Little Karoo basin and the South Coast Forelands ; and the Baviaanskloof and Gamtoos Rivers to the east . Flora ( edit ) Peninsula Shale Fynbos flora on Devils Peak , Cape Town . Gladiolus alatus flowers in Cape fynbos . The most conspicuous components of the flora are evergreen sclerophyllous plants , many with ericoid leaves and gracile habit , as opposed to timber forest . Several plant families are conspicuous in fynbos ; the Proteaceae are prominent , with genera such as Protea , Leucospermum ( the `` pincushions '' ) , and Leucadendron ( the silver tree and `` cone bushes '' ) . Proteas are represented by many species and are prominent in the landscape , generally with large striking flowers , many of which are pollinated by birds , and others by small mammals . Most of these do not have anything like ericoid leaves , and nor do most Rhamnaceae , Fabaceae , or Geraniaceae . Fynbos Ericaceae include more species of Erica than all other regions combined . They are popularly called heaths and are generally smaller plants bearing many small , tubular or globular flowers and ericoid leaves . Restionaceae also occur in greater variety in fynbos than anywhere else ; their species are superficially grass - like . Many of them grow in wet areas such as seasonal marshes and spongy basins in the sources of mountain streams , but others grow in decidedly arid conditions . Depending on the locality and the aspects under discussion , several other families have equal claim to being characteristic , including Asteraceae , Rutaceae , and Iridaceae . More than 1400 bulb species occur among the fynbos , of which 96 are Gladiolus and 54 Lachenalia . Areas that are dominated by `` renosterbos '' , Elytropappus rhinocerotis , ( Asteraceae ) are known as Renosterveld ( Afrikaans for `` rhinoceros veld '' ) . Ecoregions ( edit ) The fynbos area has been divided into two very similar ecoregions : the lowland fynbos ( below 300 m above sea level ) on the sandy soil of the west coast , and the montane fynbos of the Cape Fold Belt . Lowland fynbos , in this case Hangklip Sand Fynbos on the Cape Peninsula Montane fynbos , in this case Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos on the Cape Peninsula Renosterveld , in this case Swartland Shale Renosterveld The Lowland Fynbos and Renosterveld experiences regular winter rainfall , especially to the west of Cape Agulhas . The ecoregion has been subdivided into 9 areas : the West Coast Forelands from the Cape Flats to the Olifants River ( Western Cape ) ; the Warm Bokkeveld basin around the town of Ceres ; the Elgin Valley around the town of Elgin ; the sandy Agulhas Plain on the coast ; the Breede River valley around the town of Worcester ; the South Coast Forelands from Caledon west to Mossel Bay ; the south - eastern end of the Little Karoo ; Langkloof valley ; and the Southeastern Coast Forelands west from Tsitsikamma to Port Elizabeth . The flora of the lowlands contains a high number of endemic species , and tends to favour larger plants than those growing on the hillier areas . They include the larger Restionaceae such as species of Elegia , Thamnochortus , and Willdenowia and proteas such as king protea ( Protea cynaroides ) and blushing bride ( Serruria florida ) . Particular types of lowland fynbos include the shrubs and herbs of the coastal sand dunes , the mixture of ericoids and restoids with thickets of shrubs such as Maytenus , and other Celastraceae , sideroxylons and other Sapotaceae , and Rhus and other Anacardiaceae on the coastal sands ; the classic fynbos of the sandplains of the West Coast Forelands , and the Agulhas Plain ; the grassy fynbos of the hillier and wetter areas of the South and South - Eastern Coast Forelands ; areas where fynbos and renosterveld are mixed ; coastal renosterveld on the West and South Coast Forelands ; and the inland renosterveld of the drier inland Little Karoo and Warm Bokkeveld . The area is also home to a large number of endemic creatures that have adapted to life in this area , such as the monkey beetles which pollinate Ixia viridiflora . Endemic species of fish in the five river systems occur in the area , too . Endemic reptiles and amphibians include a number of tortoises and the chameleon - like arum frog ( Hyperolius horstockii ) . The Montane Fynbos and Renosterveld is the area above 300 m , a total of 45,000 km of the Cape Fold Mountains . The same level of floral variety , including all three characteristic fynbos families , is found there , but ericas predominate . Because the higher and wetter areas are more protected and contain important water sources , the original flora is more intact than in the lowlands ; but agriculture and global warming are stll threats . The region includes the mountains in the west from the Cape Peninsula to the Kouebokkeveld Mountains , the south coast hinterland from Elgin to Port Elizabeth , the mountains north of the Little Karoo from Laingsburg to Willowmore , and the inselberg hills within the Little Karoo . About half of these areas are originally fynbos , and about half are renosterveld . Many different microclimates occur , so the flora changes from west to east , and also varies with altitude up the hillsides away from the coast and according to compass direction . Lower elevations are covered with protea fynbos , with ericas taking over further up . Plant species include pincushions ( Leucospermum ) . The wildlife includes a number of endemic bees , beetles , horseflies , and ants , and birds such as Cape sugarbirds and the orange - breasted sunbird . Many of these birds and insects are important and specific pollinators for the fynbos , such as the mountain pride butterfly ( Aeropetes tulbaghia ) which only visits red flowers such as Disa uniflora and pollinates 15 different species . Larger animals include antelopes , particularly Cape grysbok ( Raphicerus melanotis ) , common duiker ( Sylvicapra grimmia ) , and klipspringer ( Oreotragus oreotragus ) . The extinct blue antelope and quagga were also fynbos natives . Economic uses ( edit ) Rooibos ( Aspalathus linearis ) and honeybush ( Cyclopia intermedia ) are of economic importance , grown and harvested in large quantities in the Cederberg area , and providing important exports . Restios continue to be used for thatching , as they have for hundreds or even thousands of years . Proteas and other floral species are grown in many areas and their flowers harvested for export . In many areas with Mediterranean climates , fynbos species have become popular garden plants , in particular aloes and geraniums , and in cooler regions are used as window plants . A very large number of fynbos plant species are used in traditional medicine , and while only a tiny proportion have as yet been subjected to formal testing , many have already been identified as having medicinal properties . Threats and conservation ( edit ) The regrowth of fynbos species , from around the trunk of a fallen invasive pine tree . Cape Town . The fynbos is the region of South Africa most affected by invasive alien species which collectively cover around 10 % of the entire country . The most common invasive plants are wattles and hakeas , native to Australia , and pines native to Europe and the Californian coast of the United States . Pines had been introduced to South Africa by the 19th century and the wattles were imported into the mid-1870s to stabilize sand dunes . In 1997 it was estimated that invasion caused the fynbos region to decline in value by US $750 million per year . The Working for Water ( WfW ) program was started in 1995 by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry to control these invasive species which were shown to sequester 9.95 % of usable surface water runoff . Since then , over 1,000 , 00 hectares of land have been cleared of invasive species while providing jobs to around 20,000 people per year , most of which are women and unskilled workers . Systematic monitoring of WfW 's progress is lacking but there is anecdotal evidence that endemic silver peas have returned to Table Mountain after being thought extinct .

Elsewhere he speaks of the term as `` ... applied by the inhabitants of the Cape to any sort of small woodland growth that does not include timber trees '' ; in the current vernacular , this still is the effective sense of the word . However , in the technical , ecological sense , the constraints are more demanding . In the latter half of the 20th century , `` fynbos '' gained currency as the term for the `` distinctive vegetation of the southwestern Cape '' . Cape floral kingdom The Cape Floral Kingdom ( Capensis ) is one of only 6 floristic kingdoms in the world . It is also the smallest and richest per unit of area . Main article : Cape Floristic Region Fynbos -- which grows in a 100 - to - 200 - km - wide coastal belt stretching from Clanwilliam on the West coast to Port Elizabeth on the Southeast coast -- forms part of the Cape floral kingdom , where it accounts for half of the surface area and 80 % of the plant species . The fynbos in the western regions is richer and more varied than in the eastern regions of South Africa . Of the world 's six floral kingdoms , this is the smallest and richest per unit of area . The Holarctic kingdom , in contrast , incorporates the whole of the Northern Hemisphere north of the tropics . The diversity of fynbos plants is extremely high , with over 9000 species of plants occurring in the area , around 6200 of which are endemic , i.e. growing nowhere else in the world . South Africa 's Western Cape has a level of botanic diversity that exceeds that of the richest tropical rainforest in South America , including the Amazon . Of the Ericas , over 600 occur in the fynbos kingdom , while only two or three dozen have been described in",

            "page_content": "and modern scholars have always been divided on the issue of authorship . Many consider the epistle to be written in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries . The author of the First Epistle of Peter identifies himself in the opening verse as `` Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ '' , and the view that the epistle was written by St. Peter is attested to by a number of Church Fathers : Irenaeus ( 140 -- 203 ) , Tertullian ( 150 -- 222 ) , Clement of Alexandria ( 155 -- 215 ) and Origen of Alexandria ( 185 -- 253 ) . Unlike The Second Epistle of Peter , the authorship of which was debated in antiquity , there was little debate about Peter 's authorship of this first epistle until the 18th century . Although 2 Peter internally purports to be a work of the apostle , many biblical scholars have concluded that Peter is not the author . For an early date and ( usually ) for a defense of the Apostle Peter 's authorship see Kruger , Zahn , Spitta , Bigg , and Green . The Epistle of Jude title is written as follows : `` Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James '' ( NRSV ) . The debate has continued over the author 's identity as the apostle , the brother of Jesus , both , or neither . Johannine works Main article : Authorship of the Johannine works The First Epistle of John is traditionally held to have been composed by John the Apostle ( the author of the Gospel of John ) when the writer was in advanced age . The epistle 's content , language and conceptual style indicate that it may have had the same author as the Gospel of John , 2 John and 3 John . Eusebius claimed that the author of 2nd and 3rd John was not John the Apostle , but an `` elder John '' which refers either to the apostle at an advanced age or a hypothetical second individual ( `` John the Elder '' ) . Scholars today are divided on the issue . Revelation The author of the Book of Revelation identifies himself several times as `` John '' . and states that he was on Patmos when he received his first vision . As a result , the author is sometimes referred to as John of Patmos . The author has traditionally been identified with John the Apostle to whom the Gospel and the epistles of John were attributed . It was believed that he was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian , and there wrote Revelation . Justin Martyr ( c. 100 -- 165 AD ) who was acquainted with Polycarp , who had been mentored by John , makes a possible allusion to this book , and credits John as the source . Irenaeus ( c. 115 -- 202 ) assumes it as a conceded point . According to the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible , modern scholars are divided between the apostolic view and several alternative hypotheses put forth in the last hundred years or so . Ben Witherington points out that linguistic evidence makes it unlikely that the books were written by the same person . Dates of composition See individual book articles for more detail . The earliest works that became part of the New Testament are the letters of the Apostle Paul . The earliest of the books of the New Testament was First Thessalonians , an epistle of Paul , written probably in 51 , or possibly Galatians in 49 according to one of two theories of its writing . In the 1830s German scholars of the Tübingen school tried to date the books as late as the 3rd century , but the discovery of some New Testament manuscripts and fragments from the 2nd and 3rd centuries , one of which dates as early as 125 ( Papyrus 52 ) , disproves a 3rd - century date of composition for any book now in the New Testament . Additionally , a letter to the church at Corinth in the name of Clement of Rome in 95 quotes from 10 of the 27 books of the New Testament , and a letter to the church at Philippi in the name of Polycarp in 120 quotes from 16 books . Therefore , some of the books of the New Testament must have been in circulation by the end of the first century . Scholars hold a wide spectrum of views on exactly",

It was the last episode directed by Zac Moncrief , who has been directing episodes for the show since its fourth season episode `` Peter 's Got Woods '' . Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdun acted as supervising directors for the episode . This is one of the episodes of Family Guy that was released after the show 's creator , Seth MacFarlane , joined Writers Guild of America strike . MacFarlane participated in the writing process and did record the voices of the characters he normally plays for the episode but he did not approve or participate in any post-production done to the episode . In addition to the regular cast , actor Damien Fahey and actress Tamera Mowry guest starred in the episode . Recurring voice actors Alexandra Breckenridge , Lori Alan , writer John Viener , Jeff Bergman , Lisa Wilhoit , Patrick Warburton and writer Mark Hentemann also made appearances . Cultural references The episode featured various references to the popular culture . The town of Quahog is going through a flood which has many similarities to the flood caused in New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina . Dean Cain was lampooned in the episode and in the episode he is wearing a shirt of the symbol of Superman . An alien from the film franchise of the same name appeared in the episode . Fred and Wilma Flintstone from the animated show The Flintstones are shown arguing . Since Peter ca n't find the traditional wedding cake figurines he uses a toy of The Iron Giant . Peter says that he has been a worse father than Abraham . When Stewie blows up the house he and Brian have been working on , the shot is repeated from several angles echoing the final scene from Zabriskie Point . The episode ends with `` Hello Darlin ' '' performed by Conway Twitty . Reception On the Fox network , the first airing of the episode received a 4.7 / 10 Nielsen rating / share . Ahsan Haque of IGN praised `` Peter 's Daughter '' , saying that it has `` the perfect blend of comedy and story '' , and `` thoroughly entertains from start to finish '' . He graded the episode 8.7 out of 10 . Brad Trechak of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review , stating that he enjoyed it `` much more than last week 's '' . However , Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club stated that the episode was `` pretty bland '' , though it had `` a handful of good laughs '' . She graded `` Peter 's Daughter '' B - . Robert Pierson from the TV Critic also gave the episode a positive review praising the writers for telling a plausible and logical story although he did feel that the jokes were hit and miss , he ended his review by giving the episode a 60 out of 100 . 9.60 million people watched this episode in the US on its first airing .

    "title": "Mass number",
    "document": "Mass number - wikipedia Mass number The mass number ( symbol A , from the German word Atomgewichte ( atomic weight ) , also called atomic mass number or nucleon number , is the total number of protons and neutrons ( together known as nucleons ) in an atomic nucleus . It determines the atomic mass of atoms . Because protons and neutrons both are baryons , the mass number A is identical with the baryon number B as of the nucleus as of the whole atom or ion . The mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical element . This is not the same as the atomic number ( Z ) which denotes the number of protons in a nucleus , and thus uniquely identifies an element . Hence , the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons ( N ) in a given nucleus : N = A − Z ( \\ displaystyle N = A-Z ) . The mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element 's symbol . For example , the most common isotope of carbon is carbon - 12 , or , which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons . The full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number ( Z ) as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number : C . This is technically redundant , as each element is defined by its atomic number , so it is often omitted . Mass number changes in radioactive decay ( edit ) Different types of radioactive decay are characterized by their changes in mass number as well as atomic number , according to the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy . For example , uranium - 238 usually decays by alpha decay , where the nucleus loses two neutrons and two protons in the form of an alpha particle . Thus the atomic number and the number of neutrons each decrease by 2 ( Z : 92 → 90 , N : 146 → 144 ) , so that the mass number decreases by 4 ( A = 238 → 234 ) ; the result is an atom of thorium - 234 and an alpha particle ( He ) : U → Th + He On the other hand , carbon - 14 naturally decays by radioactive beta decay , whereby one neutron is transmuted into a proton with the emission of an electron and an anti-neutrino . Thus the atomic number increases by 1 ( Z : 6 → 7 ) and the mass number remains the same ( A = 14 ) , while the number of neutrons decreases by 1 ( N : 8 → 7 ) . The resulting atom is nitrogen - 14 , with seven protons and seven neutrons : C → + + ν Another type of radioactive decay without change in mass number is emission of a gamma ray from a nuclear isomer or metastable excited state of an atomic nucleus . Since all the protons and neutrons remain in the nucleus unchanged in this process , the mass number is also unchanged . Mass number and isotopic mass ( edit ) The mass number gives an estimate of the isotopic mass measured in atomic mass units ( u ) . For C the isotopic mass is exactly 12 , since the atomic mass unit is defined as 1 / 12 of the mass of C. For other isotopes , the isotopic mass is usually within 0.1 u of the mass number . For example , Cl ( 17 protons and 18 neutrons ) has a mass number of 35 and an isotopic mass of 34.96885 . The difference between mass number of an atom and its isotopic mass is known as the mass excess . Mass excess should not be confused with mass defect which is the difference between the mass of an atom and its constituent particles ( namely protons , neutrons and electrons ) . There are two reasons for mass defect / excess : The neutron is slightly heavier than the proton . This increases the mass of nuclei with more neutrons than protons relative to the atomic mass unit scale based on C with equal numbers of protons and neutrons . The nuclear binding energy varies between nuclei . A nucleus with greater binding energy has a lower total energy , and therefore a lower mass according to Einstein 's mass - energy equivalence relation E = mc . For Cl the isotopic mass is less than 35 so this must be the dominant factor . Relative atomic mass of an element ( edit ) The mass number should also not be confused with the standard atomic weight ( also called atomic weight ) of an element , which is the ratio of the average atomic mass of the different isotopes of that element ( weighted by abundance ) to the unified atomic mass unit . The atomic weight is an actual mass ( made relative , i.e. , a ratio ) , while the mass number is a counted number ( and so an integer ) . This weighted average can be quite different from the near - integer values for individual isotopic masses . For instance , there are two main isotopes of chlorine : chlorine - 35 and chlorine - 37 . In any given sample of chlorine that has not been subjected to mass separation there will be roughly 75 % of chlorine atoms which are chlorine - 35 and only 25 % of chlorine atoms which are chlorine - 37 . This gives chlorine a relative atomic mass of 35.5 ( actually 35.4527 g / mol ) . Moreover , the weighted average mass can be near - integer , but at the same time not corresponding to the mass of any natural isotope . For example , bromine has only two stable isotopes , Br and Br , naturally present in approximately equal fractions , which leads to the standard atomic mass of bromine close to 80 ( 79.904 g / mol ) , even though the isotope Br with such mass is unstable .

            "page_content": "Mass number - wikipedia Mass number The mass number ( symbol A , from the German word Atomgewichte ( atomic weight ) , also called atomic mass number or nucleon number , is the total number of protons and neutrons ( together known as nucleons ) in an atomic nucleus . It determines the atomic mass of atoms . Because protons and neutrons both are baryons , the mass number A is identical with the baryon number B as of the nucleus as of the whole atom or ion . The mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical element . This is not the same as the atomic number ( Z ) which denotes the number of protons in a nucleus , and thus uniquely identifies an element . Hence , the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons ( N ) in a given nucleus : N = A − Z ( \\ displaystyle N = A-Z ) . The mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element 's symbol . For example , the most common isotope of carbon is carbon - 12 , or , which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons . The full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number ( Z ) as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number : C . This is technically redundant , as each element is defined by its atomic number , so it is often omitted . Mass number changes in radioactive decay Different types of radioactive decay are characterized by their changes in mass number as well as atomic number , according to the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy . For example , uranium - 238 usually decays by alpha decay , where the nucleus loses two neutrons and two protons in the form of an alpha particle . Thus the atomic number and the number of neutrons each decrease by 2 ( Z : 92 → 90 , N : 146 → 144 ) , so that the mass number decreases by 4 ( A = 238 → 234 ) ; the result is an atom of thorium - 234 and an alpha particle ( He ) : U → Th + He On the other hand , carbon - 14 naturally decays by radioactive beta decay , whereby one neutron is transmuted into a proton with the emission of an electron and an anti-neutrino . Thus the atomic number increases by 1 ( Z : 6 → 7 ) and the mass number remains the same ( A = 14 ) , while the number of neutrons decreases by 1 ( N : 8 → 7 ) . The resulting atom is nitrogen - 14 , with seven protons and seven neutrons : C → + + ν Another type of radioactive decay without change in mass number is emission of a gamma ray from a nuclear isomer or metastable excited state of an atomic nucleus . Since all the protons and neutrons remain in the nucleus unchanged in this process , the mass number is also unchanged . Mass number and isotopic mass The mass number gives an estimate of the isotopic mass measured in atomic mass units ( u ) . For C the isotopic mass is exactly 12 , since the atomic mass unit is defined as 1 / 12 of the mass of C. For other isotopes , the isotopic mass is usually within 0.1 u of the mass number . For example , Cl ( 17 protons and 18 neutrons ) has a mass number of 35 and an isotopic mass of 34.96885 . The difference between mass number of an atom and its isotopic mass is known as the mass excess . Mass excess should not be confused with mass defect which is the difference between the mass of an atom and its constituent particles ( namely protons , neutrons and electrons ) . There are two reasons for mass defect / excess : The neutron is slightly heavier than the proton . This increases the mass of nuclei with more neutrons than protons relative to the atomic mass unit scale based on C with equal numbers of protons and neutrons . The nuclear binding energy varies between nuclei . A nucleus with greater binding energy has a lower total energy , and therefore a lower mass according to Einstein 's mass - energy equivalence relation E = mc .

( December 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) `` THE CAT '' is a classic example of context effect . We have little trouble reading `` H '' and `` A '' in their appropriate contexts , even though they take on the same form in each word . A context effect is an aspect of cognitive psychology that describes the influence of environmental factors on one 's perception of a stimulus . The impact of context effects is considered to be part of top - down design . The concept is supported by the theoretical approach to perception known as constructive perception . Context effects can impact our daily lives in many ways such as word recognition , learning abilities , memory , and object recognition . It can have an extensive effect on marketing and consumer decisions . For example , research has shown that the comfort level of the floor that shoppers are standing on while reviewing products can affect their assessments of product 's quality , leading to higher assessments if the floor is comfortable and lower ratings if it is uncomfortable . Because of effects such as this , context effects are currently studied predominantly in marketing . Contents 1 Cognitive principles of context effects 2 Impact 2.1 Marketing 3 References Cognitive principles of context effects ( edit ) Context effects employ top - down design when analyzing information . Top down design fuels understanding of an image by using prior experiences and knowledge to interpret a stimulus . This process helps us analyze familiar scenes and objects when encountering them . During perception of any kind , people generally use either sensory data ( bottom - up design ) or prior knowledge of the stimulus ( top - down design ) when analyzing the stimulus . Individuals generally use both types of processing to examine stimuli . The use of both sensory data and prior knowledge to reach a conclusion is a feature of optimal probabilistic reasoning , known as Bayesian inference ; cognitive scientists have shown mathematically how context effects can emerge from the Bayesian inference process . When context effects occur , individuals are using environmental cues perceived while examining the stimuli in order to help analyze it . In other words , individuals often make relative decisions that are influenced by the environment or previous exposure to objects . These decisions may be greatly influenced by these external forces and alter the way individuals view an object . For example , research has shown that people rank television commercials as either good or bad in relation to their enjoyment levels of the show during which the commercials are presented . The more they like or dislike the show the more likely they are to rate the commercials shown during the show more positively or negatively ( respectively ) . Another example shows during sound recognition a context effect can use other sounds in the environment to change the way we categorize a sound . Context effects can come in several forms , including configural superiority effect which demonstrates varying degrees of spatial recognition depending on if stimuli are present in an organized configuration or present in isolation . For example , one may recognize a fully composed object faster than its individual parts ( object - superiority effect ) . Impact ( edit ) Context effects can have a wide range of impacts in daily life . In reading difficult handwriting context effects are used to determine what letters make up a word . This helps us analyze potentially ambiguous messages and decipher them correctly . It can also affect our perception of unknown sounds based on the noise in the environment . For example , we may fill in a word we can not make out in a sentence based on the other words we could understand . Context can prime our attitudes and beliefs about certain topics based on current environmental factors and our previous experiences with them . Context effects can be nullified if we are made consciously aware of the outside stimulus or past history that may influence our decision . For example , a study conducted by Norbert Schwarz and Gerald Clore showed that when asked to rate their overall life satisfaction on either sunny or rainy days , people expressed greater satisfaction on sunny days and less satisfaction on rainy days . However , when people were reminded of the weather their satisfaction rating returned to an almost even distribution . This study demonstrates the effect the environment can have on perception , and that when pointed out , context effects can be nullified . Context effects also affect memory . We are often better able to recall information in the location in which we learned it or studied it . For example , while studying for a test it is better to study in the environment that the test will be taken in ( i.e. classroom ) than in a location where the information was not learned and will not need to be recalled . This phenomenon is called transfer - appropriate processing . Marketing ( edit ) `` READ '' is a good example of the `` context effects '' role in the word superiority effect by having us assume that the E and the A behind the ink blot are completed . Perhaps the greatest amount of research concerning context effects comes from marketing research . Context effects can influence consumers ' choice behavior . There are three main context effects that are researched in marketing . The first , the compromise effect , states that objects that are priced in the middle of choice sets are looked on more favorably . The middle choice seems like a good compromise between choices that may be viewed as too extreme . For example , if there are bikes on sale at the local store ranging from $50 to $75 ; the average shopper , not looking for a luxury bicycle , would normally opt to choose the $60 bike because it is average and matches their level of expertise . However , when adding a $100 bike to the sale , most average shoppers would opt to select the higher $75 bike . This demonstrates the compromise effect of choosing a bike to match their expectations regarding middle prices . The attractiveness effect , the second contextual effect on consumer behavior , maintains that one item will increase the attractiveness of another item that is similar , but superior to it . By showing that an item is superior to a similar one the likability and possible purchasing power of the superior item increases . The similarity effect , the third contextual effect on consumers ' behavior , states that an item will hurt a similar item more in sales than it will a dissimilar item . With two or more similar items competing for attention they will only detract from each other in the marketplace . Firms looking to increase product resale can use these context effects to construct more profitable marketing strategies . The idea of these context effects in the marketing industry is to allow for more profitable items a boost in optional sharing ; a productivity boost based on contextual effects for and against certain items .

        "type": "Initial",
        "rag_answer": "The compromise effect in marketing refers to a phenomenon where consumers tend to choose an option that represents a middle ground or compromise among a set of choices, often perceiving it as a safer or more reasonable choice compared to extreme options.\n\nFor example, imagine a restaurant offering three sizes of coffee:\n- Small for $2\n- Medium for $3.50\n- Large for $5\n\nWhen customers see the small and large sizes, the medium size often appears as a compromise—it is not the cheapest, but not the most expensive either. Many customers might choose the medium size to avoid the extremes, illustrating the compromise effect. Marketers can use this effect by strategically positioning products so that a particular option becomes the \"compromise\" choice, potentially increasing its sales.",

No moments are transferred throughout the support , hence their structural type is known as simply supported . The simplest beam bridge could be a log ( see log bridge ) , a wood plank , or a stone slab ( see clapper bridge ) laid across a stream . Bridges designed for modern infrastructure will usually be constructed of steel or reinforced concrete , or a combination of both . The concrete elements may be reinforced , prestressed or post-tensioned . Such modern bridges include girder , plate girder , and box girder bridges , all types of beam bridges . Types of construction could include having many beams side by side with a deck across the top of them , to a main beam either side supporting a deck between them . The main beams could be I - beams ( also known as H - beams ) , trusses , or box girders . They could be half - through , or braced across the top to create a through bridge . A footbridge using beams over a stream in Dordogne , France Because no moments are transferred , thrust , as from an arch bridge , can not be accommodated , so leading to innovative designs , such as lenticular trusses & bow string arches , which contain the horizontal forces within the superstructure . Beam bridges are not limited to a single span . Some viaducts such as the Feiyunjiang Bridge in China have multiple simply supported spans supported by piers . This is opposed to viaducts using continuous spans over the piers . Beam bridges are often only used for relatively short distances because , unlike truss bridges , they have no built in supports . The only supports are provided by piers . The farther apart its supports , the weaker a beam bridge gets . As a result , beam bridges rarely span more than 250 feet ( 80 m ) . This does n't mean beam bridges are n't used to cross great distances , it only means that a series of beam bridges must be joined together , creating what 's known as a continuous span .

        "rag_answer": "For longer spans, steel and reinforced or prestressed concrete are the most suitable materials for beam bridges. These materials provide greater strength and durability compared to timber or iron, allowing beam bridges to support longer distances between piers. Steel's high tensile strength and the enhanced performance of reinforced or prestressed concrete make them ideal choices for constructing modern beam bridges with longer spans.",

        "rag_answer": "Yes, there are designs that allow beam bridges to span greater distances than usual. While beam bridges are typically limited to shorter spans because they rely on piers for support and have no built-in supports, longer distances can be achieved by joining a series of beam bridges together to create what is known as a continuous span.

    "document": "Cobalt - 60 - wikipedia Cobalt - 60 Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the nuclide cobalt - 60 . For other uses , see Cobalt - 60 ( disambiguation ) . Cobalt - 60 Complete table of nuclides General Name , symbol Cobalt - 60 , Co Neutrons 33 Protons 27 Nuclide data Natural abundance trace Half - life 5.27 years Isotope mass 59.9338222 u Spin 5 + Decay mode Decay energy β ( beta decay ) 0.31 MeV γ ( gamma - rays ) 1.1732 , 1.3325 MeV γ - ray spectrum of cobalt - 60 Cobalt - 60 , Co , is a synthetic radioactive isotope of cobalt with a half - life of 5.2714 years . It is produced artificially in nuclear reactors . Deliberate industrial production depends on neutron activation of bulk samples of the monoisotopic and mononuclidic cobalt isotope Co . Measurable quantities are also produced as a by - product of typical nuclear power plant operation and may be detected externally when leaks occur . In the latter case ( in the absence of added cobalt ) the incidentally produced Co is largely the result of multiple stages of neutron activation of iron isotopes in the reactor 's steel structures via the creation of Co precursor . The simplest case of the latter would result from the activation of Fe . Co decays by beta decay to the stable isotope nickel - 60 ( Ni ) . The activated nickel nucleus emits two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV , hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is Co + n → Co → Ni + e + ν + gamma rays . Contents ( hide ) 1 Activity 2 Decay 3 Applications 4 Occurrence 5 Safety 5.1 Steel contamination 5.2 Incidents involving medical radiation sources 6 Parity 7 Suppliers 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Activity ( edit ) Corresponding to its half - life the radioactive activity of one gram of Co is 44 T Bq ( about 1100 curies ) . The absorbed dose constant is related to the decay energy and time . For Co it is equal to 0.35 mSv / ( GBq h ) at one meter from the source . This allows calculation of the equivalent dose , which depends on distance and activity . Example : a Co source with an activity of 2.8 GBq , which is equivalent to 60 μg of pure Co , generates a dose of 1 mSv at one meter distance within one hour . The swallowing of Co reduces the distance to a few millimeters , and the same dose is achieved within seconds . Test sources , such as those used for school experiments , have an activity of < 100 kBq . Devices for nondestructive material testing use sources with activities of 1 TBq and more . The high γ - energies result in a significant mass difference between Ni and Co of 0.003 u . This amounts to nearly 20 watts per gram , nearly 30 times larger than that of Pu . Decay ( edit ) The decay scheme of Co and Co . The diagram shows a ( simplified ) decay scheme of Co and Co . The main β - decay transitions are shown . The probability for population of the middle energy level of 2.1 MeV by β - decay is 0.0022 % , with a maximum energy of 665.26 keV . Energy transfers between the three levels generate six different gamma - ray frequencies . In the diagram the two important ones are marked . Internal conversion energies are well below the main energy levels . Co is a nuclear isomer of Co with a half - life of 10.467 minutes . It decays by internal transition to Co , emitting 58.6 keV gamma rays , or with a low probability ( 0.22 % ) by β - decay into Ni . Applications ( edit ) Security screening of cars at the Super Bowl using Co gamma - ray scanner Prototype irradiator for food irradiation to prevent spoilage , 1984 . The Co is in the central pipes The main advantage of Co is that it is a high intensity gamma - ray emitter with a relatively long half - life , 5.27 years , compared to other gamma ray sources of similar intensity . The β - decay energy is low and easily shielded ; however , the gamma - ray emission lines have energies around 1.3 MeV , and are highly penetrating . The main uses for Co are : As a tracer for cobalt in chemical reactions Sterilization of medical equipment . Radiation source for medical radiotherapy . Cobalt therapy , using beams of gamma rays from Co teletherapy machines to treat cancer . Radiation source for industrial radiography . Radiation source for leveling devices and thickness gauges . Radiation source for pest insect sterilization . As a radiation source for food irradiation and blood irradiation . Cobalt has been discussed as a `` salting '' element to add to nuclear weapons , to produce a cobalt bomb , an extremely `` dirty '' weapon which would contaminate large areas with Co nuclear fallout , rendering them uninhabitable . In one hypothetical design , the tamper of the weapon would be made of Co . When the bomb exploded , the excess neutrons from the nuclear fission would irradiate the cobalt and transmute it into Co . No nation is known to have done any serious development of this type of weapon . Co needle implanted in tumors for radiotherapy , around 1955 . Co teletherapy machine for cancer radiotherapy , early 1950s . Brookhaven plant mutation experiment using Co source in the pipe , center . Co source for sterilizing screwflies in the 1959 Screwworm Eradication Program . Occurrence ( edit ) There is no natural Co in existence ; thus , synthetic Co is created by bombarding a Co target with a slow neutron source . Californium - 252 , moderated through water , can be used for this purpose , as can the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor . The CANDU reactors can be used to activate Co , by substituting the stainless steel control rods with cobalt rods . In the United States , it is now being produced in a BWR at Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station . The cobalt targets are substituted here for a small number of fuel assemblies . Co + n → Co Safety ( edit ) After entering a living mammal ( such as a human being ) , some of the Co is excreted in feces . The remainder is taken up by tissues , mainly the liver , kidneys , and bones , where the prolonged exposure to gamma radiation can cause cancer . Over time , the absorbed cobalt is eliminated in urine . Steel contamination ( edit ) Cobalt is an element used to make steel . Uncontrolled disposal of Co in scrap metal is responsible for the radioactivity found in several iron - based products . In August 2012 , Petco recalled several models of steel pet food bowls after US Customs and Border Protection determined that they were emitting low levels of radiation . The source of the radiation was determined to be Co that had contaminated the steel . In May 2013 a batch of metal - studded belts sold by online retailer ASOS were confiscated and held in a US radioactive storage facility after testing positive for Co . Incidents involving medical radiation sources ( edit ) In 2000 , a disused radiotherapy head containing a Co source was stored at an unsecured location in Bangkok , Thailand and then accidentally sold to scrap collectors . Unaware of the dangers , a junkyard employee dismantled the head and extracted the source , which remained unprotected for a period of days at the junkyard . Ten people , including the scrap collectors and workers at the junkyard , were exposed to high levels of radiation and became ill . Three of the junkyard workers subsequently died as a result of their exposure , which was estimated to be over 6 Gy . Afterward , the source was safely recovered by the Thai authorities . In December 2013 , a truck carrying a disused 111 TBq Co teletherapy source from a hospital in Tijuana to a radioactive waste storage center was hijacked at a gas station near Mexico City . The truck was recovered shortly after , but it was discovered that the thieves had removed the source from its shielding . It was found abandoned and intact in a field close by . Despite early reports with lurid headlines asserting that the thieves were `` likely doomed '' , the radiation sickness was mild enough that the suspects were quickly released to police custody , and no one is known to have died from the incident . Parity ( edit ) Main article : Wu experiment In 1957 , Chien - Shiung Wu et al. discovered the β - decay process violated parity , implying nature has a handedness . In the Wu experiment her group aligned radioactive Co nuclei by cooling the source to low temperatures in a magnetic field . Wu 's observation was that more β - rays were emitted in the opposite direction to the nuclear spin . This asymmetry violates parity conservation .

Radiation source for leveling devices and thickness gauges . Radiation source for pest insect sterilization . As a radiation source for food irradiation and blood irradiation . Cobalt has been discussed as a `` salting '' element to add to nuclear weapons , to produce a cobalt bomb , an extremely `` dirty '' weapon which would contaminate large areas with Co nuclear fallout , rendering them uninhabitable . In one hypothetical design , the tamper of the weapon would be made of Co . When the bomb exploded , the excess neutrons from the nuclear fission would irradiate the cobalt and transmute it into Co . No nation is known to have done any serious development of this type of weapon . Co needle implanted in tumors for radiotherapy , around 1955 . Co teletherapy machine for cancer radiotherapy , early 1950s . Brookhaven plant mutation experiment using Co source in the pipe , center . Co source for sterilizing screwflies in the 1959 Screwworm Eradication Program . Occurrence There is no natural Co in existence ; thus , synthetic Co is created by bombarding a Co target with a slow neutron source . Californium - 252 , moderated through water , can be used for this purpose , as can the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor . The CANDU reactors can be used to activate Co , by substituting the stainless steel control rods with cobalt rods . In the United States , it is now being produced in a BWR at Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station . The cobalt targets are substituted here for a small number of fuel assemblies .

The remainder is taken up by tissues , mainly the liver , kidneys , and bones , where the prolonged exposure to gamma radiation can cause cancer . Over time , the absorbed cobalt is eliminated in urine . Steel contamination Cobalt is an element used to make steel . Uncontrolled disposal of Co in scrap metal is responsible for the radioactivity found in several iron - based products . In August 2012 , Petco recalled several models of steel pet food bowls after US Customs and Border Protection determined that they were emitting low levels of radiation . The source of the radiation was determined to be Co that had contaminated the steel . In May 2013 a batch of metal - studded belts sold by online retailer ASOS were confiscated and held in a US radioactive storage facility after testing positive for Co .

Parity Main article : Wu experiment In 1957 , Chien - Shiung Wu et al. discovered the β - decay process violated parity , implying nature has a handedness . In the Wu experiment her group aligned radioactive Co nuclei by cooling the source to low temperatures in a magnetic field . Wu 's observation was that more β - rays were emitted in the opposite direction to the nuclear spin . This asymmetry violates parity conservation .

During the Third and Fourth Republics , the head of government position was called President of the Council of Ministers ( French : Président du Conseil des Ministres ) , generally shortened to President of the Council ( French : Président du Conseil ) . The Prime Minister proposes a list of ministers to the President of the Republic . Decrees and decisions of the Prime Minister , like almost all executive decisions , are subject to the oversight of the administrative court system . Few decrees are taken after advice from the Council of State ( French : Conseil d'État ) . All prime ministers defend the programs of their ministry , and make budgetary choices . The extent to which those decisions lie with the Prime Minister or President depends upon whether they are of the same party . Manuel Valls was appointed to lead the government in a cabinet reshuffle in March 2014 , after the ruling Socialists suffered a bruising defeat in local elections . However , he resigned on 6 December 2016 , to stand in the French Socialist Party presidential primary , 2017 and Bernard Cazeneuve was appointed as Prime Minister later that day by President François Hollande . Cazeneuve resigned on 10 May 2017 . Édouard Philippe was named his successor on 15 May 2017 . Contents ( hide ) 1 Nomination 2 Role 3 History 4 Present 5 Fifth Republic records 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Nomination ( edit ) The Prime Minister is appointed by the President of the Republic , who can select whomever they want . While prime ministers are usually chosen from amongst the ranks of the National Assembly , on rare occasions the President has selected a non-officeholder because of their experience in bureaucracy or foreign service , or their success in business management -- Dominique de Villepin , for example , served as Prime Minister from 2005 to 2007 without ever having held an elected office . On the other hand , while the Prime Minister does not have to ask for vote of confidence after cabinet 's formation and they can depend their legitimacy on the President 's assignment as Prime Minister and approval of the cabinet , because the National Assembly does have the power to force the resignation of the cabinet by motion of no confidence , the choice of Prime Minister must reflect the will of the majority in the Assembly . For example , right after the legislative election of 1986 , President François Mitterrand had to appoint Jacques Chirac Prime Minister although Chirac was a member of the RPR ( Rally for the Republic ) and therefore a political opponent of Mitterrand . Despite the fact that Mitterrand 's own Socialist Party was the largest party in the Assembly , it did not have an absolute majority . The RPR had an alliance with the UDF , which gave them a majority . Such a situation , where the President is forced to work with a Prime Minister who is an opponent , is called a cohabitation . Édith Cresson is the only woman to have held the position of Prime Minister . Aristide Briand holds the record for number of cabinet formations as Prime Minister with 11 times . He served between 1909 and 1929 with some terms as short as 26 days . Role ( edit ) According to article 21 of the Constitution , the Prime Minister `` shall direct the actions of the Government '' ; in addition , article 20 stipulates that the Government `` shall determine and conduct the policy of the Nation '' . Other members of Government are appointed by the President `` on the recommendation of the Prime Minister '' . In practice the Prime Minister acts on the impulse of the President to whom he is a subordinate , except when there is a cohabitation in which case his responsibilities are akin to those of a prime minister in a parliamentary system . The Prime Minister can `` engage the responsibility '' of his or her Government before the National Assembly . This process consists of placing a bill before the Assembly , and either the Assembly overthrows the Government , or the bill is passed automatically ( article 49 ) . In addition to ensuring that the Government still has support in the House , some bills that might prove too controversial to pass through the normal Assembly rules are able to be passed this way . The Prime Minister may also submit a bill that has not been yet signed into law to the Constitutional Council ( article 61 ) . Before he is allowed to dissolve the Assembly , the President has to consult the Prime Minister and the presidents of both Houses of Parliament ( article 12 ) . History ( edit ) Official reception at Hôtel Matignon . The office of the prime minister , in its current form , dates from the formation of the French Third Republic . Under the French Constitutional Laws of 1875 , the position was imbued with the same powers as his British counterpart . In practice , however , the prime minister was a fairly weak figure , serving as little more than the cabinet 's `` primus inter pares '' . Most notably , the legislature had the power to force the entire cabinet out of office by a vote of censure . As a result , cabinets were often toppled twice a year , and there were long stretches where France was left with only a caretaker government . The 1958 Constitution includes several provisions intended to strengthen the prime minister 's position . For instance , restrictions were placed on votes of censure . Present ( edit ) The current prime minister is Édouard Philippe , who was appointed on 15 May 2017 . Fifth Republic records ( edit ) Length of the successive governments of the french Fifth Republic The only person to serve as Prime Minister more than once under the Fifth Republic was Jacques Chirac ( 1974 -- 1976 and 1986 -- 1988 ) . The youngest appointed Prime Minister was Laurent Fabius , on 17 July 1984 . He was 37 years old . The oldest appointed Prime Minister was Pierre Bérégovoy , on 2 April 1992 . He was 66 years old . The only woman who was appointed at the head of government is Edith Cresson , Prime minister from 1991 to 1992 . Two Prime Ministers were mayor of Bordeaux , and at the same time prime minister , Jacques Chaban - Delmas ( 1969 -- 1972 ) and Alain Juppé ( 1995 -- 1997 ) . The longest - serving Prime Minister was Georges Pompidou , 6 years , 2 months and 26 days , from 1962 to 1968 . The shortest - serving Prime Minister was Bernard Cazeneuve , 5 months and 4 days , from 2016 to 2017 . Three Prime Ministers were born abroad : Édouard Balladur in İzmir , Turkey , Dominique de Villepin in Rabat , Morocco and Manuel Valls in Barcelona , Spain .

    "document": "Wernicke 's area - wikipedia Wernicke 's area Jump to : navigation , search Wernicke 's area Approximate location of Wernicke 's area highlighted in grey Identifiers MeSH D065813 NeuroNames 1233 NeuroLex ID nlx_144087 FMA 242178 Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy ( edit on Wikidata ) Wernicke 's area ( / ˈvɛərnɪkə / or / ˈvɛərnɪki / ; German : ( ˈvɛʁnɪkə ) ) , also called Wernicke 's speech area , is one of the two parts of the cerebral cortex that are linked to speech ( the other is Broca 's area ) . It is involved in the comprehension or understanding of written and spoken language ( in contrast to Broca 's area that is involved in the production of language ) . It is traditionally thought to be in Brodmann area 22 , which is located in the superior temporal lobe in the dominant cerebral hemisphere ( which is the left hemisphere in about 95 % of right handed individuals and 60 % of left handed individuals ) . Damage caused to Wernicke 's area results in receptive , fluent aphasia . This means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words , but the phrases will lack meaning . This is unlike non-fluent aphasia , in which the person will use meaningful words , but in a non-fluent , telegraphic manner . Contents ( hide ) 1 Structure 2 Function 2.1 Right homologous area 2.2 Modern views 3 Clinical significance 3.1 Aphasia 4 References Structure ( edit ) Wernicke 's area is classically located in the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) in the ( most commonly ) left cerebral hemisphere . This area encircles the auditory cortex on the lateral sulcus ( the part of the brain where the temporal lobe and parietal lobe meet ) . This area is neuroanatomically described as the posterior part of Brodmann area 22 . However , there is an absence of consistent definitions as to the location . Some identify it with the unimodal auditory association in the superior temporal gyrus anterior to the primary auditory cortex ( the anterior part of BA 22 ) . This is the site most consistently implicated in auditory word recognition by functional brain imaging experiments . Others include also adjacent parts of the heteromodal cortex in BA 39 and BA40 in the parietal lobe . While previously thought to connect Wernicke 's area and Broca 's area , new research demonstrates that the arcuate fasciculus instead connects to posterior receptive areas with premotor / motor areas , and not to Broca 's area . Consistent with the word recognition site identified in brain imaging , the uncinate fasciculus connects anterior superior temporal regions with Broca 's area . Function ( edit ) Right homologous area ( edit ) Research using Transcranial magnetic stimulation suggests that the area corresponding to the Wernicke 's area in the non-dominant cerebral hemisphere has a role in processing and resolution of subordinate meanings of ambiguous words -- such as ' ' river ' ' when given the ambiguous word `` bank . '' In contrast , the Wernicke 's area in the dominant hemisphere processes dominant word meanings ( ' ' teller ' ' given ' ' bank ' ' ) . Modern views ( edit ) Neuroimaging suggests the functions earlier attributed to Wernicke 's area occur more broadly in the temporal lobe and indeed happen also in Broca 's area . `` There are some suggestions that middle and inferior temporal gyri and basal temporal cortex reflect lexical processing ... there is consensus that the STG from rostral to caudal fields and the STS constitute the neural tissue in which many of the critical computations for speech recognition are executed ... aspects of Broca 's area ( Brodmann areas 44 and 45 ) are also regularly implicated in speech processing . ... the range of areas implicated in speech processing go well beyond the classical language areas typically mentioned for speech ; the vast majority of textbooks still state that this aspect of perception and language processing occurs in Wernicke 's area ( the posterior third of the STG ) . '' Support for a broad range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study done at University of Rochester in which American Sign Language native speakers were subject to MRIs while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax ( relationship is determined by the word order ) or inflection ( relationship is determined by physical motion of `` moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body '' ) . Distinct areas of the brain were activated with the frontal cortex ( associated with ability to put information into sequences ) being more active in the syntax condition and the temporal lobes ( associated with dividing information into its constituent parts ) being more active in the inflection condition . However , these areas are not mutually exclusive and show a large amount of overlap . These findings imply that while speech processing is a very complex process , the brain may be using fairly basic , preexisting computational methods . Clinical significance ( edit ) Human brain with Wernicke 's area highlighted in red Aphasia ( edit ) Wernicke 's area is named after Carl Wernicke , a German neurologist and psychiatrist who , in 1874 , hypothesized a link between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables that associated the sensory and motor images of spoken words . He did this on the basis of the location of brain injuries that caused aphasia . Receptive aphasia in which such abilities are preserved is also known as Wernicke 's aphasia . In this condition there is a major impairment of language comprehension , while speech retains a natural - sounding rhythm and a relatively normal syntax . Language as a result is largely meaningless ( a condition sometimes called fluent or jargon aphasia ) . While neuroimaging and lesion evidence generally support the idea that malfunction of or damage to Wernicke 's area is common in people with receptive aphasia , this is not always so . Some people may use the right hemisphere for language , and isolated damage of Wernicke 's area cortex ( sparing white matter and other areas ) may not cause severe receptive aphasia . Even when patients with Wernicke 's area lesions have comprehension deficits , these are usually not restricted to language processing alone . For example , one study found that patients with posterior lesions also had trouble understanding nonverbal sounds like animal and machine noises . In fact , for Wernicke 's area , the impairments in nonverbal sounds were statistically stronger than for verbal sounds . References ( edit ) Jump up ^ `` Aphasia : Signs & Symptoms '' .

        "question": "Is Wernicke's area always located in the posterior third of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) of the brain, or can it sometimes be found in other locations?",
        "answer": "There is an absence of consistent definitions as to the location [of Wernicke's area]. Some identify it with the unimodal auditory association in the superior temporal gyrus anterior to the primary auditory cortex (the anterior part of BA 22). Others include also adjacent parts of the heteromodal cortex in BA 39 and BA40 in the parietal lobe. Some people may use the right hemisphere for language.",

        "rag_answer": "It is not always the case that language processing, specifically functions related to Wernicke's area, is confined to the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus. Some people may use the right hemisphere for language. Additionally, isolated damage to Wernicke's area cortex (while sparing white matter and other areas) may not cause severe receptive aphasia. Therefore, language-related processing can sometimes be found or compensated for elsewhere in the brain.",

        "answer": "It is involved in the comprehension or understanding of written and spoken language (in contrast to Broca's area that is involved in the production of language). This means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words, but the phrases will lack meaning.

        "rag_answer": "The provided context explains Wernicke's aphasia but does not provide specific details about Broca's aphasia or a direct comparison between Wernicke's and Broca's aphasia.\n\nBased on general knowledge:\n- Wernicke's aphasia (receptive aphasia) results from damage to Wernicke's area and is characterized by a major impairment in language comprehension. Speech produced is fluent and has a natural rhythm and normal syntax but is largely meaningless or nonsensical (sometimes called jargon aphasia).\n- Broca's aphasia (expressive aphasia), not described in the context, typically involves damage to Broca's area in the frontal lobe. It is characterized by non-fluent, effortful speech with relatively preserved comprehension. Patients often understand language better than they can speak and produce short, broken sentences.\n\nTherefore, the main difference is that Wernicke's aphasia primarily affects language comprehension with fluent but nonsensical speech, whereas Broca's aphasia primarily affects speech production, resulting in non-fluent, effortful speech with relatively preserved comprehension. \n\nSince the context does not mention Broca's aphasia, this answer is based on general neuroscience knowledge outside the given passage.",

    "document": "Phase ( matter ) - wikipedia Phase ( matter ) Jump to : navigation , search Not to be confused with State of matter . In the physical sciences , a phase is a region of space ( a thermodynamic system ) , throughout which all physical properties of a material are essentially uniform . Examples of physical properties include density , index of refraction , magnetization and chemical composition . A simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform , physically distinct , and ( often ) mechanically separable . In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar , the ice cubes are one phase , the water is a second phase , and the humid air over the water is a third phase . The glass of the jar is another separate phase . ( See state of matter # Glass ) The term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter , but there can be several immiscible phases of the same state of matter . Also , the term phase is sometimes used to refer to a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a phase boundary on a phase diagram . Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter , such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another , this latter usage is similar to the use of `` phase '' as a synonym for state of matter . However , the state of matter and phase diagram usages are not commensurate with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from the context in which the term is used . A small piece of rapidly melting argon ice shows the transition from solid to liquid . Contents ( hide ) 1 Types of phases 2 Phase equilibrium 3 Number of phases 4 Interfacial phenomena 5 Crystal phases 6 Phase transitions 7 See also 8 Notes 9 References 10 External links Types of phases ( edit ) Iron - carbon phase diagram , showing the conditions necessary to form different phases Distinct phases may be described as different states of matter such as gas , liquid , solid , plasma or Bose -- Einstein condensate . Useful mesophases between solid and liquid form other states of matter . Distinct phases may also exist within a given state of matter . As shown in the diagram for iron alloys , several phases exist for both the solid and liquid states . Phases may also be differentiated based on solubility as in polar ( hydrophilic ) or non-polar ( hydrophobic ) . A mixture of water ( a polar liquid ) and oil ( a non-polar liquid ) will spontaneously separate into two phases . Water has a very low solubility ( is insoluble ) in oil , and oil has a low solubility in water . Solubility is the maximum amount of a solute that can dissolve in a solvent before the solute ceases to dissolve and remains in a separate phase . A mixture can separate into more than two liquid phases and the concept of phase separation extends to solids , i.e. , solids can form solid solutions or crystallize into distinct crystal phases . Metal pairs that are mutually soluble can form alloys , whereas metal pairs that are mutually insoluble can not . As many as eight immiscible liquid phases have been observed . Mutually immiscible liquid phases are formed from water ( aqueous phase ) , hydrophobic organic solvents , perfluorocarbons ( fluorous phase ) , silicones , several different metals , and also from molten phosphorus . Not all organic solvents are completely miscible , e.g. a mixture of ethylene glycol and toluene may separate into two distinct organic phases . Phases do not need to macroscopically separate spontaneously . Emulsions and colloids are examples of immiscible phase pair combinations that do not physically separate . Phase equilibrium ( edit ) Left to equilibration , many compositions will form a uniform single phase , but depending on the temperature and pressure even a single substance may separate into two or more distinct phases . Within each phase , the properties are uniform but between the two phases properties differ . Water in a closed jar with an air space over it forms a two phase system . Most of the water is in the liquid phase , where it is held by the mutual attraction of water molecules . Even at equilibrium molecules are constantly in motion and , once in a while , a molecule in the liquid phase gains enough kinetic energy to break away from the liquid phase and enter the gas phase . Likewise , every once in a while a vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid . At equilibrium , evaporation and condensation processes exactly balance and there is no net change in the volume of either phase . At room temperature and pressure , the water jar reaches equilibrium when the air over the water has a humidity of about 3 % . This percentage increases as the temperature goes up . At 100 ° C and atmospheric pressure , equilibrium is not reached until the air is 100 % water . If the liquid is heated a little over 100 ° C , the transition from liquid to gas will occur not only at the surface , but throughout the liquid volume : the water boils . Number of phases ( edit ) See also : Multiphasic liquid A typical phase diagram for a single - component material , exhibiting solid , liquid and gaseous phases . The solid green line shows the usual shape of the liquid -- solid phase line . The dotted green line shows the anomalous behavior of water when the pressure increases . The triple point and the critical point are shown as red dots . For a given composition , only certain phases are possible at a given temperature and pressure . The number and type of phases that will form is hard to predict and is usually determined by experiment . The results of such experiments can be plotted in phase diagrams . The phase diagram shown here is for a single component system . In this simple system , which phases that are possible depends only on pressure and temperature . The markings show points where two or more phases can co-exist in equilibrium . At temperatures and pressures away from the markings , there will be only one phase at equilibrium . In the diagram , the blue line marking the boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely , but terminates at a point called the critical point . As the temperature and pressure approach the critical point , the properties of the liquid and gas become progressively more similar . At the critical point , the liquid and gas become indistinguishable . Above the critical point , there are no longer separate liquid and gas phases : there is only a generic fluid phase referred to as a supercritical fluid . In water , the critical point occurs at around 647 K ( 374 ° C or 705 ° F ) and 22.064 MPa . An unusual feature of the water phase diagram is that the solid -- liquid phase line ( illustrated by the dotted green line ) has a negative slope . For most substances , the slope is positive as exemplified by the dark green line . This unusual feature of water is related to ice having a lower density than liquid water . Increasing the pressure drives the water into the higher density phase , which causes melting . Another interesting though not unusual feature of the phase diagram is the point where the solid -- liquid phase line meets the liquid -- gas phase line . The intersection is referred to as the triple point . At the triple point , all three phases can coexist . Experimentally , the phase lines are relatively easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases forms . See Gibbs ' phase rule . Consider a test apparatus consisting of a closed and well insulated cylinder equipped with a piston . By charging the right amount of water and applying heat , the system can be brought to any point in the gas region of the phase diagram . If the piston is slowly lowered , the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram . At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid , the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of the water has condensed . Interfacial phenomena ( edit ) Further information : Surface science Between two phases in equilibrium there is a narrow region where the properties are not that of either phase . Although this region may be very thin , it can have significant and easily observable effects , such as causing a liquid to exhibit surface tension . In mixtures , some components may preferentially move toward the interface . In terms of modeling , describing , or understanding the behavior of a particular system , it may be efficacious to treat the interfacial region as a separate phase . Crystal phases ( edit ) A single material may have several distinct solid states capable of forming separate phases . Water is a well - known example of such a material . For example , water ice is ordinarily found in the hexagonal form ice I , but can also exist as the cubic ice I , the rhombohedral ice II , and many other forms . Polymorphism is the ability of a solid to exist in more than one crystal form . For pure chemical elements , polymorphism is known as allotropy . For example , diamond , graphite , and fullerenes are different allotropes of carbon . Phase transitions ( edit ) Main article : Phase transition When a substance undergoes a phase transition ( changes from one state of matter to another ) it usually either takes up or releases energy . For example , when water evaporates , the increase in kinetic energy as the evaporating molecules escape the attractive forces of the liquid is reflected in a decrease in temperature . The energy required to induce the phase transition is taken from the internal thermal energy of the water , which cools the liquid to a lower temperature ; hence evaporation is useful for cooling . See Enthalpy of vaporization . The reverse process , condensation , releases heat . The heat energy , or enthalpy , associated with a solid to liquid transition is the enthalpy of fusion and that associated with a solid to gas transition is the enthalpy of sublimation .

A common example is the mixture of water (a polar liquid) and oil (a non-polar liquid), which spontaneously separates into two phases because water has very low solubility in oil, and oil has very low solubility in water. Multiple immiscible liquid phases can exist simultaneously, with as many as eight immiscible liquid phases having been observed. These phases can be formed from various substances such as water (aqueous phase), hydrophobic organic solvents, perfluorocarbons (fluorous phase), silicones, different metals, and molten phosphorus. Additionally, not all organic solvents are completely miscible; for example, ethylene glycol and toluene can separate into two distinct organic phases.

In the physical sciences , a phase is a region of space ( a thermodynamic system ) , throughout which all physical properties of a material are essentially uniform . Examples of physical properties include density , index of refraction , magnetization and chemical composition . A simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform , physically distinct , and ( often ) mechanically separable . In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar , the ice cubes are one phase , the water is a second phase , and the humid air over the water is a third phase . The glass of the jar is another separate phase . ( See state of matter # Glass ) The term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter , but there can be several immiscible phases of the same state of matter . Also , the term phase is sometimes used to refer to a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a phase boundary on a phase diagram . Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter , such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another , this latter usage is similar to the use of `` phase '' as a synonym for state of matter . However , the state of matter and phase diagram usages are not commensurate with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from the context in which the term is used . A small piece of rapidly melting argon ice shows the transition from solid to liquid .

Useful mesophases between solid and liquid form other states of matter . Distinct phases may also exist within a given state of matter . As shown in the diagram for iron alloys , several phases exist for both the solid and liquid states . Phases may also be differentiated based on solubility as in polar ( hydrophilic ) or non-polar ( hydrophobic ) . A mixture of water ( a polar liquid ) and oil ( a non-polar liquid ) will spontaneously separate into two phases . Water has a very low solubility ( is insoluble ) in oil , and oil has a low solubility in water . Solubility is the maximum amount of a solute that can dissolve in a solvent before the solute ceases to dissolve and remains in a separate phase . A mixture can separate into more than two liquid phases and the concept of phase separation extends to solids , i.e. , solids can form solid solutions or crystallize into distinct crystal phases . Metal pairs that are mutually soluble can form alloys , whereas metal pairs that are mutually insoluble can not . As many as eight immiscible liquid phases have been observed . Mutually immiscible liquid phases are formed from water ( aqueous phase ) , hydrophobic organic solvents , perfluorocarbons ( fluorous phase ) , silicones , several different metals , and also from molten phosphorus . Not all organic solvents are completely miscible , e.g. a mixture of ethylene glycol and toluene may separate into two distinct organic phases . Phases do not need to macroscopically separate spontaneously . Emulsions and colloids are examples of immiscible phase pair combinations that do not physically separate . Phase equilibrium Left to equilibration , many compositions will form a uniform single phase , but depending on the temperature and pressure even a single substance may separate into two or more distinct phases . Within each phase , the properties are",

        "rag_answer": "Yes, there is research on \"cold feet\" in the context of marriage. A four-year study conducted by UCLA researchers found that feelings of pre-marital doubt or uncertainty about an impending marriage were associated with future marital problems and served as a viable predictor of divorce. This suggests that experiencing \"cold feet\" before a wedding may indicate potential challenges in the marriage ahead.",

            "page_content": "Cold feet - wikipedia Cold feet Cold feet is a phrase which refers to a person not going through with an action , particularly one which requires long term commitment , due to fear , uncertainty , and doubt . A person is said to be `` getting cold feet '' when , after previously committing to a plan , they ultimately do not carry out the planned course of action . Contents ( hide ) 1 Definitions ( psychological ) 2 Origin and history 3 Common uses 3.1 Marriage 4 References 5 External links Definitions ( psychological ) Apprehension or doubt strong enough to prevent a planned course of action . A loss or lack of courage or confidence ; an onset of uncertainty or fear . To `` have cold feet '' is to be too fearful to undertake or complete an action . A wave of timidity or fearfulness . Loss or lack of courage or confidence . Timidity that prevents the continuation of a course of action . Origin and history The origin of the term itself has been largely attributed to American author Stephen Crane , who added the phrase , in 1896 , to the second edition of his short novel , Maggie : A Girl of the Streets . Crane writes , `` I knew this was the way it would be . They got cold feet . '' The term is present in `` Seed Time and Harvest '' by Fritz Reuter published in 1862 . Kenneth McKenzie , a former professor of Italian at Princeton University attributed the first use of the phrase to the play Volpone produced by Ben Jonson in 1605 . The true origin and first usage of the phrase remains debated and unconfirmed as exemplified above . Common uses Marriage A common use of the phrase is when people fear the commitment of marriage and get `` cold feet '' before a wedding ceremony . This pre-marital doubt or fear may manifest for a variety of reasons and sometimes cause the bride or groom to back out of a planned marriage . Original research on the `` cold feet '' phenomenon is very limited , but a four - year study conducted by UCLA researchers found feelings of pre-marital doubt or uncertainty about an impending marriage were associated with future marital problems and a viable predictor of divorce .

    "document": "In His Eyes - wikipedia In His Eyes Jump to : navigation , search This article is an orphan , as no other articles link to it . Please introduce links to this page from related articles ; try the Find link tool for suggestions . ( April 2016 ) Jekyll and Hyde CD cover `` In His Eyes '' is a song performed in the musical Jekyll and Hyde , composed by Frank Wildhorn with lyrics by Frank Wildhorn , Leslie Bricusse and Steve Cuden . Jekyll and Hyde premiered on Broadway in 1997 and has since seen many subsequent international , as well as regional , productions . In 2013 , the show was revived on Broadway . The song appeared in the Original Broadway production performed by Linda Eder and Christiane Noll . Contents ( hide ) 1 Context 2 Musical analysis 3 Textual analysis 4 References Context ( edit ) Jekyll and Hyde tells the story of a doctor , Jekyll , who , trying to find the basis of good and evil , develops an evil alter ego , Hyde . The song is sung by the two female leads , Lucy and Emma . Emma , Jekyll 's fiancé , is a refined young woman who is reluctant to support her husband 's experiments fearing that he is becoming too involved in the process . Lucy is a prostitute at a gentlemen 's club who becomes infatuated with the Hyde persona , eventually resulting in her death . While the two characters are very different , they both love the same man , albeit different personas within the same physicality . In this song , they lament about their separate desires for Jekyll / Hyde to see how much they love him and how their lives have been altered by the man and his experiments . Both women dream about their futures , with or without Jekyll / Hyde . They both , separately , come to the realization that their love for him is much too strong to ever truly break away . In mutual agreement , they recognize that when they look into the eyes of the man they love , they are filled with everything they need to continue on . The song ends with them fully believing that the love they have for Jekyll / Hyde enriches their lives and are committed to doing whatever they can for him . Lucy was initially played by Linda Eder ( Wildhorn 's wife , at the time of production ) in the Houston World Premiere , 1st US Tour , and the Original Broadway show . Emma was initially played by Rebecca Spencer ( character name of `` Lisa '' ) for the Houston World Premiere , and then Christiane Noll ( character name of `` Emma '' ) 1st US Tour , and the Original Broadway show . Musical analysis ( edit ) The song is a ballad duet in which the two women sing , but never truly interact with each other . Emma , a soprano with a classically operatic timbre , begins by singing a solo verse , which Lucy , a mezzo - soprano , with a raspy , forward tone , then copies , with different lyrics but the same melody . The song ends with the two overlapping similar lyrics , but most staging requires that the two are singing in their own world , about their own feelings , unaware of the other , even though they are singing the same song , at the same time . The song begins freely , with both women singing their verse rubato . As the two sing about not knowing where their future lies and other solemn wordings , the piece is in C - minor . Once they begin to ponder about how important Jekyll / Hyde is in their lives and how much they adore him , the piece modulates to B - flat major , creating a shift in musical feel to echo the shift lyrically . The song also quickens in tempo as the two women begin to make conclusions about their feelings and decisions about their actions . Accompanied by Bass ( Acoustic and Electric ) , Cello , Horn , Keyboard ( x3 ) , Percussion ( x2 ) , Reed 1 ( Alto Flute & Flute ) , Reed 2 ( English Horn & Oboe ) , Reed 3 ( Alto Saxophone , Bass Clarinet , & Clarinet ) , Reed 4 ( Bassoon , Contrabassoon ) , Trombone , Trumpet , Viola , Violin ( x2 ) . The character of Emma sings with notes ranging from Bb to Eb ( 2 octaves above ) , while Lucy sings with notes ranging from Bb to F ( 2 octaves above ) . While the two utilize a similar span of notes , the way in which they sing alters how these notes sound . As mentioned , the timbre differs between the two women , reflecting their pasts and , perhaps most importantly , their class status , with Emma being the daughter of a knighted man and Lucy being a prostitute in the local brothel , The Red Rat . Textual analysis ( edit ) The piece emphasizes the emotional states of Emma and Lucy and their overall feeling of longing . Emma is singing about losing elements of her husband as he is becoming Hyde and her inner struggle with his change and distance from her . Instead of angry , she seems more hurt and confused because she truly loves him . Lucy is singing about falling in love with a man that she does not understand. He has awakened a new side of her and she is fascinated with how someone like him could love someone like her , yet she is perplexed by him and unsure how they could have a real future together . Although the song does not advance the plot , it serves to further describe the emotions and feelings of the ladies , developing their characters and revealing their thoughts . By the end of the song , the audience is assured of both Emma and Lucy 's full devotion to Jekyll / Hyde . This song is easily and commonly excerpted due the vague nature of the lyrics . `` In His Eyes '' never uses specific names or places within the world of the play , and discusses a feeling and theme that is highly relatable , making the song a perfect stand - alone piece . Other than the Original Broadway Cast Recording , the song has been recorded by various artists such as Brandi Burkdhart and Kate Shindle , and Teal Wicks and Deborah Cox . Christiane Noll , who originated Emma on Broadway , has recorded various tracks with artists Christie LaVerdiere and Debbie Gravitte . `` In His Eyes '' has even been adapted into a solo piece for one voice and has been recorded as such by Mindy Jostyn , Elizabeth Harmetz , Emma Hunton , Casey Erin Clark , and others .

        "answer": "The piece emphasizes the emotional states of Emma and Lucy and their overall feeling of longing . Emma is singing about losing elements of her husband as he is becoming Hyde and her inner struggle with his change and distance from her . Instead of angry , she seems more hurt and confused because she truly loves him . Lucy is singing about falling in love with a man that she does not understand. He has awakened a new side of her and she is fascinated with how someone like him could love someone like her , yet she is perplexed by him and unsure how they could have a real future together . Although the song does not advance the plot , it serves to further describe the emotions and feelings of the ladies , developing their characters and revealing their thoughts . By the end of the song , the audience is assured of both Emma and Lucy 's full devotion to Jekyll / Hyde .",

The character of Emma sings with notes ranging from Bb to Eb ( 2 octaves above ) , while Lucy sings with notes ranging from Bb to F ( 2 octaves above ) . While the two utilize a similar span of notes , the way in which they sing alters how these notes sound . As mentioned , the timbre differs between the two women , reflecting their pasts and , perhaps most importantly , their class status , with Emma being the daughter of a knighted man and Lucy being a prostitute in the local brothel , The Red Rat . Textual analysis The piece emphasizes the emotional states of Emma and Lucy and their overall feeling of longing . Emma is singing about losing elements of her husband as he is becoming Hyde and her inner struggle with his change and distance from her . Instead of angry , she seems more hurt and confused because she truly loves him . Lucy is singing about falling in love with a man that she does not understand. He has awakened a new side of her and she is fascinated with how someone like him could love someone like her , yet she is perplexed by him and unsure how they could have a real future together . Although the song does not advance the plot , it serves to further describe the emotions and feelings of the ladies , developing their characters and revealing their thoughts . By the end of the song , the audience is assured of both Emma and Lucy 's full devotion to Jekyll / Hyde . This song is easily and commonly excerpted due the vague nature of the lyrics . `` In His Eyes '' never uses specific names or places within the world of the play , and discusses a feeling and theme that is highly relatable , making the song a perfect stand - alone piece . Other than the Original Broadway Cast Recording , the song has been recorded by various artists such as Brandi Burkdhart and Kate Shindle , and Teal Wicks and Deborah Cox . Christiane Noll , who originated Emma on Broadway , has recorded various tracks with artists Christie LaVerdiere and Debbie Gravitte . `` In His Eyes '' has even been adapted into a solo piece for one voice and has been recorded as such by Mindy Jostyn , Elizabeth Harmetz , Emma Hunton , Casey Erin Clark , and others .

It was a combination of a walking and tram tour of the backlot area of the park . The Studio Backlot Tour was one of two original attractions at Disney 's Hollywood Studios , the other being the Great Movie Ride . Originally the park 's premier attraction , it shut down in the fall of 2014 , after years of downscaling , for newer experiences not announced at the time . In August 2015 , it was announced that the area would be used for Toy Story Land . The entire attraction has now been demolished . Contents ( hide ) 1 History 1.1 Original ride 1.2 Refurbishment 1.3 Closure 2 Attractions 2.1 The queue area 2.2 Walking tour 2.3 Tram tour 2.4 Post-ride 3 References 4 External links History ( edit ) Original ride ( edit ) Attraction 's marquee The first incarnation of the Backlot Tour loaded at the former entrance to The Magic of Disney Animation . The original tour was far longer and more elaborate than the final version . The former tour originally drove through New York Street / Streets of America . However , due to the surprise popularity of the park , New York Street was removed from the tour and made into a public walking space within the first few years of operation . It remained open to pedestrians until April 2 , 2016 when Streets of America closed . After driving through New York Street , the tram drove to Catastrophe Canyon . After visiting the canyon , guests disembarked at the final tour 's exit area . The area where Studio Catering Co. restaurant & the adjacent shop stood until Streets of America closed was originally a break area for guests before embarking on the second half of the Backlot tour . This break area was expanded to include an area for kids to play , called Honey , I Shrunk the Kids : Movie Set Adventure . The second half of the tour was a walking tour . It encompassed the water special effects tank , an effects shop , and the existing soundstages along Mickey Avenue and the soundstages that currently house Walt Disney : One Man 's Dream and Voyage of the Little Mermaid . Guests viewed the soundstages using overhead walkways . Portions of the walkway can still be seen in the park . Most noticeably , by the most recent Backlot Tour entrance and by the former The Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow entrance , there are walkway bridges . Just like New York Street , due to the overwhelming popularity of Disney 's Hollywood Studios , former Backlot areas were opened up to guests ( present day Mickey Avenue & southern Animation Courtyard ) . Much of the former walking portion of the Backlot Tour became its own attraction , Backstage Pass , separate from the original tour . This greatly reduced the overall Tour time . Around this same time , the entrance to the Backlot Tour was moved to the end of Mickey Avenue , with a new entrance ramp built to the water effects tank , a prop warehouse building constructed for additional queue , and a new loading area for the trams . In 2001 , Backstage Pass was closed . In April 2001 , Soundstage 3 opened to the public to house Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - Play It ! and was closed in 2006 . In 2008 , Soundstage 3 and the adjacent Soundstage 2 were converted into the Toy Story Midway Mania ! attraction . Soundstage 1 previously housed a gift shop for `` Star Wars Weekends '' . In the summer of 2014 , it housed `` Wandering Oaken 's Trading Post and Sauna '' . Currently , it houses the third track to the popular Toy Story Midway Mania ! . The adjacent building , an unnamed enclosed area and theater , housed for many years an attraction called `` The Making of ______ '' ( the blank filled in with the name of the next upcoming film from either Walt Disney Pictures or Touchstone Pictures ) . When the walking tour was removed from the Backlot Tour , this became a separate attraction , the previously mentioned Backstage Pass attraction . In 2001 , the space was converted into Walt Disney : One Man 's Dream . Originally the display area of the building emptied into the theater currently occupied by Voyage of The Little Mermaid . Within months of the park 's opening , the theater became a separate venue from the walking tour portion of the Backlot Tour . The first show in the new separate theater was Here Come the Muppets . When the original theater was separated , a new slightly smaller theater was built right behind it for `` The Making of '' attraction . This is the current theater guests enter in Walt Disney : One Man 's Dream . Refurbishment ( edit ) Walt Disney 's private airplane on display In 2003 , Residential Street was walled off from the tour and demolished . The land was used for The Lights , Motors , Action Stunt Show . The addition of the stunt show caused the Backlot Tour to be re-routed to go around the large stadium . Small portions of the former residential street were turned into areas for the tour 's relocated and downsized boneyard and for the tram roadways . The addition of the stunt show also caused NY Street to lose its arch , as the area was needed for the tour tram to turn around to arrive at the exit station . Overall , the tram portion of the tour was obviously greatly reduced due to the new stunt show . In 2008 , Imagineering announced to cast members that an automated narration spiel was in development to replace all the live tour guides on the shuttles portion of the tour . The Special Effects Water Tank continued to have a live cast until the attraction closed due to volunteer guests . The entire attraction went down for two months ' refurbishment on January 4 , 2009 . The ride briefly closed down in February 2010 , along with the adjacent Studio Catering Company and Honey I Shrunk the Kids Movie Set Adventure . It was the final refurbishment before the attraction closed . Closure ( edit ) On September 20 , 2014 it was announced to cast members that the ride would temporarily close on September 27 , 2014 for the orchestral facility . On September 28 , the marquee and the sign that were at the entrance were removed and painted over . At the time of the attraction 's closing , there was no word as to what would replace it . However , it was later annonouced at the D23 Expo 2015 that the land taking up the Backlot Tour , as well as the majority of the Streets of America area would make room for Star Wars and Toy Story - themed lands . Construction began in mid-2016 . Attractions ( edit ) The queue area ( edit ) Upon entering the queue , guests were put into four different lines underneath a large canopy . Throughout the area were props from different movies , including Pearl Harbor , Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl , and The Rock . A film also looped with director Michael Bay telling guests how some of the special effects scenes from Pearl Harbor were filmed . While guests were waiting , four volunteers were chosen to be used in the first part of the attraction . Walking tour ( edit ) A number of guests in each line were taken into a show area with a large water tank in front of them . In the water tank were props reminiscent of Pearl Harbor : the deck and the engine room of a patrol boat . Cast Members explained how the water tank and props could be used in filming scenes from action films . Using the volunteers from before the guests were shown a special effects demonstration , known as Harbor Attack . One volunteer sat in the engine room and was overcame by a deluge of water ( 1000 Gallons of Water ) coming into the room through a window from two dump tanks . The other three volunteers were standing on the deck when an attack happened . Explosions underwater , simulated torpedo bursts , and fireballs were used to simulate the attack . When filming was finished the footage was put together with previously recorded footage of airplane attacks and dialogue and shown to the guests . When the demonstration was finished , guests continued into a large prop warehouse . The line moved guests up and down aisles of props used in different major productions , including Marvin 's Room , The Santa Clause , Honey , I Shrunk the Kids , Honey , I Blew Up the Kid , Who Framed Roger Rabbit , `` The Rocketeer '' , The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , The Great Muppet Caper , and George of the Jungle . Several of the props were tagged with information . At the exit of the building the tram part of the tour began . Tram tour ( edit ) Catastrophe Canyon before the deluge ... ... and during As guests exited the prop building they boarded onto a tram for the main part of the tour . As the driver brought the tram through different areas , a prerecorded narration explained what was found there and tells the guests facts about it . Guests first traveled past the Earffel Tower , the former icon of the park . The tram ride was the closest that guests could get to the tower in the park . After the tower the tram drove through the costume and materials building , which had a thru - way for the tram and windows for guests to see the costumes and people working . A highlight in the building was the room full of tires used for the Lights , Motors , Action ! Extreme Stunt Show . When the tram left the building it would bring the guests through an outside area named the boneyard ( named after an aircraft boneyard ) . In the boneyard vehicles featured in many films could be seen . Props included the genuine steamroller used by Judge Doom during the climax of Who Framed Roger Rabbit , ships from the original Star Wars films , the duo motorcycles from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , the escape pod from The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , cars used in the Herbie the Love Bug films ( the ex-parade vehicle Herbie was taken away from the All - Star Movies Resort ( on account of children kept climbing on it ) and was on display on the tour ) , bone cages from Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chest , the spaceship from Flight of the Navigator and boats and other vehicles used in other Disney - produced films . After leaving the boneyard , guests were told that they would be entering a `` live '' movie set while the cast was on break . The tram would then move into an area known as Catastrophe Canyon , a rocky area with a fuel truck and water tanks inside of it . While the tram was stopped , filming starts suddenly . An earthquake shakes the tram and causes the fuel truck to explode , sending a fire ball into the air . Then a flood of water comes rushing down from the canyon and from above the tram . When the earthquake subsides and the water stops , the set would then begin to reset for the next tram and the host on the tram tells guests how it was done as the tram travels behind the set to show the back of the production . After exiting the canyon the tram traveled through parts of the boneyard again . Guests would go past the Lights , Motors , Action ! Extreme Stunt Show stadium and practice areas . The tram also passed Walt Disney 's private airplane . After passing the plane , the tram pulls in to the exit and unloaded into the AFI Showcase room .

The original tour was far longer and more elaborate than the final version . The former tour originally drove through New York Street / Streets of America . However , due to the surprise popularity of the park , New York Street was removed from the tour and made into a public walking space within the first few years of operation . It remained open to pedestrians until April 2 , 2016 when Streets of America closed . After driving through New York Street , the tram drove to Catastrophe Canyon . After visiting the canyon , guests disembarked at the final tour 's exit area . The area where Studio Catering Co. restaurant & the adjacent shop stood until Streets of America closed was originally a break area for guests before embarking on the second half of the Backlot tour . This break area was expanded to include an area for kids to play , called Honey , I Shrunk the Kids : Movie Set Adventure . The second half of the tour was a walking tour . It encompassed the water special effects tank , an effects shop , and the existing soundstages along Mickey Avenue and the soundstages that currently house Walt Disney : One Man 's Dream and Voyage of the Little Mermaid . Guests viewed the soundstages using overhead walkways . Portions of the walkway can still be seen in the park . Most noticeably , by the most recent Backlot Tour entrance and by the former The Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow entrance , there are walkway bridges .

It contains an interpolation from `` Ex-Factor '' , written and performed by Lauryn Hill , which itself samples `` Can It Be All So Simple '' , written and performed by Wu - Tang Clan . The latter song also samples `` The Way We Were '' . Therefore , Hill , the members of Wu - Tang Clan , and Marvin Hamlisch , Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman are credited among the composers . A song about infidelity , `` Be Careful '' was inspired by her past romantic relationships in New York City , which annoyed Almanzar when she was finishing recording Invasion of Privacy there . `` Be Careful '' peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 , and reached the top 40 in Canada , Ireland , New Zealand and the United Kingdom . Contents 1 Background and release 2 Composition 3 Music video 4 Live performances 5 Charts 6 Certifications 7 Release history 8 References Background and release ( edit ) A draft of one verse for `` Be Careful '' was first written by Jordan Thorpe . Later , Cardi and the producers Frank Dukes , Boi - 1da and Vinylz added the hook and finished writing the rest of the song . Cardi was motivated to write the song when she was in New York City finishing her debut album , Invasion of Privacy ( 2018 ) . Annoyed about her past romantic relationships and the unfaithfulness in them , she found herself tense and upset -- prioritising work , with too many bad thoughts . `` Be Careful '' , the third and final single that preceded the album , was recorded at Chuing King Studios in NY by Commissioner Gordon ( who also recorded Lauryn Hill 's Ex-Factor single in the same studio ) and mixed at Hit Factory Studios in New York as well . The song was released a week after its recording with `` Drip '' on February 2018 . Composition ( edit ) Cardi B performs the hook using a softly sung vocal style over a `` laidback '' beat . The song also comprises `` flickering '' hi - hats and `` slick '' synths . Lyrically , `` Be Careful '' is a song about infidelity , where the performer warns her cheating partner and asks him to treat her better . During an interview , Cardi B expressed she drew inspiration from past relationships , while denying that the song was directed at her fiancé Offset . Music Video ( edit ) Directed by Jora Frantzis , the song 's music video premiered on May 21 , 2018 . The clip opens with a wedding in a church filled with Jesus statues and crucifixes located in the middle of the dessert . Cardi B walks down the aisle in a wedding dress . The clip shifts to a darker hue as the rapper returns to the church , this time for her husband 's funeral . Live performances ( edit ) On April 7 , 2018 , Cardi B performed `` Be Careful '' on Saturday Night Live . During the performance she revealed her pregnancy .

    "document": "Doctor of Physical Therapy - wikipedia Doctor of Physical Therapy Jump to : navigation , search A Doctor of Physical Therapy ( DPT ) degree is a post-baccalaureate degree that takes 7 years to complete . A DPT is considered as a clinical doctor who is educated in many areas of rehabilitation . A Transitional Doctor of Physical Therapy Degree is also offered for those who already hold a professional Bachelor or Master of Physical Therapy ( PT or MPT ) degree . As of 2015 , all accredited and developing physical therapist programs are DPT programs . The DPT degree currently prepares students to be eligible for the PT license examination in all 50 states . As of March 2017 , there are 222 accredited Doctor of Physical Therapy programs in the United States . After completing a DPT program the doctor of physical therapy may continue training in a residency and then fellowship . As of December 2013 , there are 178 credentialed physical therapy residencies and 34 fellowships in the US with 63 additional developing residencies and fellowships . Credentialed residencies are between 9 and 36 months while credentialed fellowships are between 6 and 36 months . In 2000 the American Physical Therapy Association ( APTA ) passed its Vision 2020 statement , which states ( in part ) : `` By 2020 , physical therapy will be provided by physical therapists who are doctors of physical therapy , recognized by consumers and other health care professionals as the practitioners of choice to whom consumers have direct access for the diagnosis of , interventions for , and prevention of impairments , functional limitations , and disabilities related to movement , function , and health . '' As this statement highlights , the DPT program is an integral part of the APTA 's continued advocacy for legislation granting consumers ( i.e. patients and clients ) direct access to physical therapists , rather than requiring physician referral . Direct access is said to decrease wait times for access to care and even help reduce both cost to consumer and overall healthcare costs . As of January 1 , 2015 , all 50 states and the District of Columbia currently allow some form of direct access to physical therapists . Contents ( hide ) 1 History of the DPT degree 2 Time frame 3 Admission 4 Transition Doctor of Physical Therapy degree 5 Controversies 6 Professional degree ( entry - level ) 7 Advanced clinical science degree 8 United Kingdom 9 References 10 External links History of the DPT degree ( edit ) In 1992 , the University of Southern California initiated the first post-professional `` transitional '' ( DPT ) program in the United States . This `` transitional '' DPT takes into account a physiotherapist 's current level of knowledge and skill and purports to offer programs that upgrade clinical skills to meet the needs of the current health care environment . Creighton University followed by initiating the first entry - level DPT program in 1993 . The Doctor of Physiotherapy has since been adopted in other countries such as the United Kingdom , Australia and Taiwan . In the United Kingdom and Australia the PhD or Professional Doctorate in Physiotherapy is offered by a number of Universities . These programmes are usually professional entry masters level programmes with the opportunity to undertake research to lead to a doctorate degree . Alternatively , these programmes are masters pre-qualifying Physiotherapy courses with an enhanced research element in the final phase of the course that leads to undertaking a doctorate . The first full pre-qualifying doctor in Physiotherapy programme is offered in the United Kingdom at Glasgow Caledonian University in Glasgow . Time frame ( edit ) Undergraduate Doctor of Physical Therapy Residency ( optional ) Fellowship ( optional ) 4 years 3 -- 4 years 9 to 36 months 6 to 36 months The typical time frame for completion of a Doctor of Physical Therapy is 3 to 4 years after earning a bachelor 's degree . Depending on residency and fellowship training , if undertaken , the doctor may have completed several years of additional training . Admission ( edit ) Admission to a Doctor of Physical Therapy program in the USA is highly competitive . As of 2011 the average GPA for enrolling students was 3.5 with a range of 3.1 to 3.9 for all programs . On average there were 354.7 applicants per program with an average of 43.3 students enrolled per class for an average matriculation rate of 12.2 % . The range for applicants to all programs as of 2011 was 34 - 1358 , and the range of enrolled students was 6 - 354 . A bachelor 's degree generally is required before beginning a Doctor of Physical Therapy program , but there is no requirement on the degree earned , as long as all prerequisite course requirements are met . Transition Doctor of Physical Therapy degree ( edit ) The t - DPT degree is conferred upon completion of a structured postprofessional educational experience that results in the augmentation of knowledge , skills , and behaviors to a level consistent with the current professional ( entry - level ) DPT standards . The t - DPT degree enables the US - licensed physical therapist to attain degree parity with therapists who hold the professional DPT by filling in any gaps between their professional baccalaureate or master 's degree PT education and the current professional DPT degree education . The post-professional DPT ( Transitional ) degree is designed to provide the doctoral credential to those who currently holding a master 's or bachelor 's degree in the field . Post-professional DPT ( Transitional ) degree programs are typically offered on a primarily online learning model and are often one year in length . Controversies ( edit ) The use of the title doctor by physical therapists and other non-physician health care professionals is controversial . In a letter to The New York Times , the president of the American Physical Therapy Association responded : `` To provide accurate information to consumers , the American Physical Therapy Association has taken a proactive approach and provides clear guidelines for physical therapists regarding the use of the title `` Doctor . '' These guidelines state that physical therapists , in all clinical settings , who hold a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree ( DPT ) shall indicate they are physical therapists when using the title `` Doctor '' or `` Dr , '' and shall use the titles in accord with jurisdictional law . '' The DPT degree has been described as an example of `` credential creep '' or degree inflation in The Chronicle of Higher Education . Citing concerns that the DPT , and similar professional doctorates in areas such as occupational therapy , do not meet the standards of traditional doctorate degrees , the journal states : `` The six - and - a-half - year doctor of physical therapy , or DPT , is rapidly replacing a six - year master 's degree ... The American Physical Therapy Association ... has not set separate requirements for doctoral programs . To be accredited they need only to meet the same requirements as master 's programs . '' Critics question whether the rigor of the physical therapy curriculum and the current scope of practice warrant the conferral of a professional degree similar to that characteristic of medicine , dentistry , or nursing . Proponents counter that the existing curricula are `` victims of ' curricular inflation ' . '' As Rothstein and Moffat noted , the previous master 's and even baccalaureate curricula rival that of most other doctoral programs , and these curricula often require more than the typical 72 credits mandated for a doctoral degree . The 2000 Fact Sheet from APTA reported that the mean number of credits required for the professional phase of the typical baccalaureate program was 83.0 credits and that the typical master 's degree program required 95.5 credits . As of 2009 the typical number of prerequisite credits was 114.2 and the total number of professional credits was 116.5 for a total of 230.7 credit hours . This is well in excess of the typical 72 professional credits mandated for a doctoral degree . Additional credit hours may be earned in residency and fellowship as well . Threlkeld et al. suggest that the scope of existing physical therapy curricula already matches that of a professional doctorate , further submitting that students of a well - defined DPT program will have earned the right to be recognized with the doctoral title . Professional degree ( entry - level ) ( edit ) The professional ( entry - level ) DPT degree is currently the degree conferred by all physical therapist professional programs upon successful completion of a three - to four - year post-baccalaureate degree program in the United States , preparing the graduate to enter the practice of physical therapy . Admission requirements for the program include completion of an undergraduate degree that includes specific prerequisite coursework , volunteer experience ( or other exposure to the profession ) , and completion of a standardized graduate examination ( e.g. , GRE ) . Typical prerequisite courses may include two semesters of anatomy and physiology with labs , two semesters of physics with labs , two semesters of chemistry with labs , a general course in psychology , another course in psychology , statistics , two semesters of biology , and may include other courses required by specific schools . The physical therapist curriculum consists of foundational sciences ( i.e. , gross anatomy , cellular histology , embryology , neurology , neuroscience , kinesiology , physiology , exercise physiology , pathology , pharmacology , radiology / imaging , medical screening ) , behavioral sciences ( communication , social and psychologic factors , ethics and values , law , business and management sciences , clinical reasoning and evidence - based practice ) , and clinical sciences ( cardiovascular / pulmonary , endocrine and metabolic , gastrointestinal and genitourinary , integumentary , musculoskeletal , neuromuscular ) . Coursework also includes material specific to the practice of physical therapy ( patient / client management model , prevention , wellness , and health promotion , practice management , management of care delivery , social responsibility , advocacy , and core values ) . Additionally , students have to engage in full - time clinical practice under the supervision of licensed physical therapists with an expectation of providing safe , competent , and effective physical therapy . Advanced clinical science degree ( edit ) The `` advanced clinical science '' doctorate ( e.g. , DPTSc or DScPT , DHSc , ScDPT ) is one of several degrees conferred by academic institutions upon successful completion of a post-professional physical therapist education program . This program is intended to provide an experienced clinician with advanced knowledge , clinical skills , and professional behavior , usually in a specific specialty practice area . These programs typically culminate work that contributes new knowledge to clinical practice in the profession . Completion of these advanced clinical science doctoral programs may include credentialed clinical residencies and lead to ABPTS clinical specialization or other advanced certifications . United Kingdom ( edit ) Some UK universities now offer a DPT as a post-professional qualification , but the qualifying degree remains Bachelor or Master of Science , Physiotherapy ( with honours ) . The Doctor of Physiotherapy in the UK differs from a US clinical doctorate in that it is a post-professional Physiotherapy specific research programme , which is offered at the University of Sussex in Brighton , Nottingham University and Robert Gordon University . Glasgow Caledonian University in Glasgow now offers a 3.5 year Doctor in Physiotherapy ( pre-registration ) programme which is the first clinical doctorate which leads to qualification as a Physiotherapist eligible to register with the CSP and HCPC in the United Kingdom . This programme provides a focus on researcher development as well as professional development within a health and social care context .

The film crew constructed a set in Georgia after extensively studying the Alhonna Resort property . Some scenes are filmed at Chicago locations . Only a few scenes from the pilot were shot in the actual city of Lake Ozark , Missouri , which include shots of the locally famous `` Welcome To Lake Of the Ozarks '' sign and the `` Injun Joe Muffler Man '' statue .

Critical reception ( edit ) Ozark has received positive reviews , particularly for Bateman 's non-comedic performance . On Metacritic , the series has a score of 67 out of 100 based on 28 reviews , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . On Rotten Tomatoes , it has a 64 % approval rating with an average score of 6.81 out of 10 based on 53 reviews . The site 's critical consensus reads , `` Ozark has n't yet reached the same level as the classic crime dramas to which it will inevitably be compared , but its satisfyingly complex plot -- and a gripping performance from Jason Bateman -- suggest greater potential . '' Brian Lowry of CNN wrote , `` While the fish - out - of - water concept is one of TV 's oldest , Ozark carves out its own path with clever twists -- including a late - in - the - run flashback explaining how the cartel came into his life -- and the sheer strength of the performances . '' TV critic Sonia Saraiya of Variety wrote that Ozark is `` smart , well - crafted , and says something , '' and that the series `` comes together under Bateman 's disarming and deceptively complex performance as Marty . '' Tim Dowling of The Guardian wrote `` Laura Linney is , as ever , magnificent '' . Critics compared Ozark positively to Breaking Bad , both of which involve a seemingly normal protagonist suddenly immersed in a world of crime . According to Film Daily , `` Once you get past the surface similarities , Ozark shines as something special and inventive , an intense crime opera where the scenery is as much the star as anyone in the cast .

He employed some Marxian concepts on political economy , but rejected Marx 's stages of history , and economic history generally . Contents ( hide ) 1 Biography 2 Works and ideas 3 Selected publications 3.1 Books 3.2 Journal articles 3.3 Book chapters 4 See also 5 References 5.1 Notes 5.2 Further reading 6 External links Biography ( edit ) Frank was born in Germany to Jewish parents , pacifist writer Leonhard Frank and his second wife Elena Maqenne Penswehr , but his family fled the country when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor . Frank received schooling in several places in Switzerland , where his family settled , until they emigrated to the United States in 1941 . Frank 's undergraduate studies were at Swarthmore College . He earned his Ph. D. in economics in 1957 at the University of Chicago . His doctorate was a study of Soviet agriculture entitled Growth and Productivity in Ukrainian Agriculture from 1928 to 1955 . Ironically , his dissertation supervisor was Milton Friedman , a man whose laissez faire approach to economics Frank would later harshly criticize . Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s Frank taught at American universities . In 1962 he moved to Latin America , inaugurating a remarkable period of travel that confirmed his peripatetic tendencies . His most notable work during this time was his stint as Professor of Sociology and Economics at the University of Chile , where he was involved in reforms under the government of Salvador Allende . After Allende 's government was toppled by a coup d'état in 1973 , Frank fled to Europe , where he occupied a series of university positions . From 1981 until his retirement in 1994 he was professor in developmental economy at the University of Amsterdam . He was married to Marta Fuentes , with whom he wrote several studies about social movements , and with Marta he had two sons . Marta died in Amsterdam in June 1993 . His second wife was sociologist Nancy Howell , a friend for forty years : while married to her , they lived in Toronto . Frank died in 2005 of complications related to his cancer while under the care of his third wife , Alison Candela . Works and ideas ( edit ) During his career , Frank taught and did research in departments of anthropology , economics , geography , history , international relations , political science , and sociology . He worked at nine universities in North America , three in Latin America , and five in Europe . He gave countless lectures and seminars at dozens of universities and other institutions all around the world in English , French , Spanish , Portuguese , Italian , German and Dutch . Frank wrote widely on the economic , social and political history and contemporary development of the world system , the industrially developed countries , and especially of the Third World and Latin America . He produced over 1,000 publications in 30 languages . His last major article , `` East and West '' , appeared in the volume : `` Dar al Islam . The Mediterranean , the World System and the Wider Europe : The `` Cultural Enlargement '' of the EU and Europe 's Identity '' edited by Peter Herrmann ( University College Cork ) and Arno Tausch ( Innsbruck University ) , published by Nova Science Publishers , New York . His work in the 1990s focused on world history . He returned to his analysis of global political economy in the new millennium inspired by a lecture he gave at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga ( SSE Riga ) . In 2006 SSE Riga received Andre Gunder Frank 's personal library collection and set - up the Andre Gunder Frank Memorial Library in his honor , with the support of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation . Frank was a prolific author , writing 40 books . He published widely on political economy , economic history , international relations , historical sociology , and world history . Perhaps his most notable work is Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America . Published in 1967 , it was one of the formative texts in dependency theory . In his later career he produced works such as ReOrient : Global Economy in the Asian Age and , with Barry Gills , The World System : Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand . Frank 's theories center on the idea that a nation 's economic strength , largely determined by historical circumstances -- especially geography -- dictates its global power . He is also well known for suggesting that purely export oriented solutions to development create imbalances detrimental to poor countries . Frank has made significant contributions to the world - systems theory ( which , according to him , should be rather called the World System one ) . He has argued that a World System was formed no later than in the 4th millennium BC ; his argument contrasts sharply with the scholarly majority who posit beginnings in the `` long 16th century '' ( a position held , for example , by Immanuel Wallerstein ) . Frank also insisted that the idea of numerous `` world - systems '' did not make much sense ( indeed , if there are many `` world - systems '' in the world , then they simply do not deserve to be called `` world - systems '' ) , and we should rather speak about one single World System . Andre Gunder Frank and Professor David Landes , author of The Wealth and Poverty of Nations , are noted for having come to very different conclusions about the long view significance of economic developments in `` the West '' during the modern era and publicly debated their findings in 1998 at Northeastern University . In one of his last essays , Frank made arguments about the looming global economic crisis of 2008 . Selected publications ( edit ) Books ( edit ) ( 1966 ) The Development of Underdevelopment .

        "rag_answer": "\"Fooled Around and Fell in Love\" is a song written and performed by blues guitarist Elvin Bishop. It appeared on his 1975 album \"Struttin' My Stuff\" and was released as a single in March 1976. Although Elvin Bishop wrote the song, he did not sing the lead vocals because he felt that his gravelly voice wouldn't suit the track. Instead, he invited Mickey Thomas, who was a background singer in his band at the time, to sing lead vocals.\n\nThe song achieved significant chart success. It peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in May 1976. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on June 23, 1976. In Canada, the song reached number 22 on the singles chart and number 8 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It also reached number 16 on the Australian chart.\n\nThe personnel for the song included:\n- Mickey Thomas: vocals\n- Elvin Bishop: guitar\n- Johnny 'V' Vernazza: guitar, backing vocals\n- Philip Aaberg: piano\n- Mike Keck: organ\n- Donny Baldwin: drums, percussion\n- Michael Brooks: bass\n- Bill Szymczyk: producer\n\nBased on his performance on this song, Mickey Thomas was later invited to become the lead singer for Jefferson Starship.",

    "document": "Hung jury - wikipedia Hung jury Jump to : navigation , search For an album , see Hung Jury ( album ) . A hung jury or deadlocked jury is a judicial jury that can not agree upon a verdict after extended deliberation and is unable to reach the required unanimity or supermajority . This situation can occur only in common law legal systems , because civil law systems either do not use juries at all or provide that the defendant is automatically acquitted if the majority or supermajority required for conviction is not reached during a single , solemn vote . Contents ( hide ) 1 Canada 2 New Zealand 3 United Kingdom 3.1 England and Wales 3.2 Scotland 4 United States 4.1 Hung jury in death penalty trials 5 References Canada ( edit ) In Canada , the jury must reach a unanimous decision on criminal cases . Each jury in criminal courts contain twelve jurors , but not in civil cases . In civil cases , only six people are necessary for a jury , and if there is one dissenter but the rest are unanimous ( i.e. a 5 - 1 vote ) the one dissenter can be ignored with the majority opinion becoming the final verdict . If the jury can not reach a unanimous decision , a hung jury is declared . A new panel of jurors will be selected for the new trial . New Zealand ( edit ) In New Zealand , the jury must initially try to reach a unanimous verdict . If the jury can not reach a unanimous verdict after a reasonable time given the nature and complexity of the case ( but not less than four hours ) , then the court may accept a majority verdict . In criminal cases , an all - but - one majority is needed ( i.e. 11 -- 1 with a full jury ) ; in civil cases , a three - fourths majority is needed ( i.e. 9 -- 3 with a full jury ) . If the jury fails to reach either a unanimous or majority verdict after a reasonable time , the presiding judge may declare a hung jury , and a new panel of jurors will be selected for a retrial . United kingdom ( edit ) England and Wales ( edit ) In England and Wales a majority of 10 -- 2 ( 10 -- 1 if only eleven jurors remain ) is needed for a verdict ; failure to reach this may lead to a retrial . Initially , the jury will be directed to try to reach a unanimous verdict . If they fail to reach a unanimous verdict , the judge may later ( after not less than two hours ) give directions that a majority verdict will be acceptable , but still no less than ten to two , although the jury should continue to try to reach a unanimous verdict if possible . When the jury are called to deliver a verdict after majority directions have been given , a careful protocol of questions is followed : only in the event of a guilty verdict is it then asked whether or not all jurors were agreed on that verdict , to prevent any acquittal from being tainted by it being disclosed that any jurors dissented . The protocol is followed separately for each charge . Scotland ( edit ) It is not possible to have a hung jury in Scotland in criminal cases . Juries consist of 15 , and verdicts are decided by simple majority ( 8 ) of the initial membership . If jurors drop out because of illness or another reason , the trial can continue with a minimum of 12 jurors , but the support of 8 jurors is still needed for a guilty verdict ; anything less is treated as an acquittal . In civil cases there is a jury of 12 , with a minimum of 10 needed to continue the trial . It is possible to have a hung jury if there is a tied vote after three hours ' deliberation . United states ( edit ) In the United States , the result is a mistrial , and the case may be retried ( United States v. Perez , 1824 ) . Some jurisdictions permit the court to give the jury a so - called Allen charge , inviting the dissenting jurors to re-examine their opinions , as a last - ditch effort to prevent the jury from hanging . The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure state , `` The verdict must be unanimous ... If there are multiple defendants , the jury may return a verdict at any time during its deliberations as to any defendant about whom it has agreed ... If the jury can not agree on all counts as to any defendant , the jury may return a verdict on those counts on which it has agreed ... If the jury can not agree on a verdict on one or more counts , the court may declare a mistrial on those counts . A hung jury does not imply either the defendant 's guilt or innocence . The government may retry any defendant on any count on which the jury could not agree . '' Juries in criminal cases are generally , as a rule , required to reach a unanimous verdict , and juries in civil cases typically have to reach a majority on some level . If a defendant has been found guilty of a capital offense , one that could result in the death penalty if the person is eligible , the opinion of the jury must be unanimous if the defendant is to be sentenced to death . Currently , two states , Oregon and Louisiana , do not require unanimous verdicts in criminal cases . Each requires a 10 - 2 majority for conviction , except for capital crimes : Oregon requires at least 11 votes and Louisiana requires all 12 . In jurisdictions giving those involved in the case a choice of jury size ( such as between a six - person and twelve - person jury ) , defense counsel in both civil and criminal cases frequently opt for the larger number of jurors . A common axiom in criminal cases is that `` it takes only one to hang , '' referring to the fact that in some cases , a single juror can defeat the required unanimity . One proposal for dealing with the difficulties associated with hung juries has been to introduce supermajority verdicts to allow juries to convict defendants without unanimous agreements amongst the jurors . Hence , a 12 - member jury that would otherwise be deadlocked at 11 for conviction and 1 against , would be recorded as a guilty verdict . The rationale for majority verdicts usually includes arguments involving so - called ' rogue jurors ' who unreasonably impede the course of justice . Opponents of majority verdicts argue that it undermines public confidence in criminal justice systems and results in a higher number of individuals convicted of crimes they did not commit . In United States military justice , the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( 10 U.S.C. Chapter 47 ) Article 52 specifies the minimum number of court martial panel members required to return a verdict of guilty . In cases that involve a mandatory death sentence , a unanimous vote of all panel members is required . In cases that involve mandatory life sentences or sentences of confinement over ten years , a three - fourths vote is required . In all other cases , only a two - thirds vote is required to convict . Additionally , the Manual for Courts - Martial requires only a judge and a specified number of panel members ( five for a general court - martial or three for a special court - martial ; no panel is seated for a summary court - martial ) in all non-capital cases . In capital cases , a panel of 12 members is required . Hung jury in death penalty trials ( edit ) Of the 31 U.S. states with the death penalty , 29 provide the sentence to be decided by a jury , and 28 require a unanimous sentence . However , the states differ on what happens if the penalty phase results in a hung jury : In 4 states ( Arizona , California , Kentucky and Nevada ) , a retrial of the penalty phase will be conducted before a different jury ( the common - law rule for mistrial ) . In 2 states ( Indiana and Missouri ) , the judge will decide the sentence . In the 22 other states , a hung jury results in a life sentence , even if only one juror opposed death . Federal law also provides that outcome . The first outcome is referred as the `` true unanimity '' rule , while the third has been criticized as the `` single - juror veto '' rule . In Alabama , the sentence is decided by the jury and at least 10 jurors must concur . A retrial happens if the jury deadlock . Nebraska is the only state in which the sentence is decided by a three - judge panel . If one of the judges on the panel opposes death , the defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment . Montana is the only state where the trial judge decides the sentence alone . In all states in which the jury is involved , only death - qualified veniremen can be selected in such a jury , to exclude both people who will always vote for the death sentence and those who are categorically opposed to it .

        "question": "Given the discussion about hung juries in death penalty cases, and specifically Nebraska's procedure where a single judge opposing death results in a life sentence, is Nebraska's sentencing outcome considered the 'single-juror veto' rule?",
        "answer": "Yes, the outcome in the 22 states where a hung jury results in a life sentence, even if only one juror opposed death, is criticized as the “single - juror veto ” rule.",
        "type": "Clarification",
        "rag_answer": "No, Nebraska's sentencing process is not considered a \"single-juror veto\" because the sentence is decided by a three-judge panel, not by a jury. However, the panel does have a similar feature in that if even one of the three judges opposes the death penalty, the defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment. The term \"single-juror veto\" typically refers to a single member of a jury having the power to prevent a death sentence, whereas Nebraska's process involves judges rather than jurors.",

    "document": "Horse latitudes - wikipedia Horse latitudes Jump to : navigation , search It has been suggested that this article be merged with Subtropical ridge . ( Discuss ) Proposed since May 2017 . This article is about the geographical area . For other uses , see Horse latitudes ( disambiguation ) . A diagram showing the relative positions of the Horse latitudes Horse latitudes or subtropical highs are subtropical latitudes between 30 and 38 degrees both north and south where Earth 's atmosphere is dominated by the subtropical high , an area of high pressure , which suppresses precipitation and cloud formation , and has variable winds mixed with calm winds . The horse latitudes are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large - scale descent of air from high - altitude currents moving toward the poles . After reaching the earth 's surface , this air spreads toward the equator as part of the prevailing trade winds or toward the poles as part of the westerlies . The belt in the Northern Hemisphere is sometimes called the `` calms of Cancer '' and that in the Southern Hemisphere the `` calms of Capricorn '' . The consistently warm , dry , and sunny conditions of the horse latitudes are the main cause for the existence of the world 's major non-polar deserts , such as the Sahara Desert in Africa , the Arabian and Syrian deserts in the Middle East , the Mojave and Sonoran deserts in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico , all in the Northern Hemisphere ; and the Atacama Desert , the Kalahari Desert , and the Australian Desert in the Southern Hemisphere . Contents ( hide ) 1 Etymology 2 Cultural references 3 See also 4 References 5 Further reading Etymology ( edit ) A likely and documented explanation is that the term is derived from the `` dead horse '' ritual of seamen ( see Beating a dead horse ) . In this practice , the seaman paraded a straw - stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck before throwing it overboard . Seamen were paid partly in advance before a long voyage , and they frequently spent their pay all at once , resulting in a period of time without income . If they got advances from the ship 's paymaster , they would incur debt . This period was called the `` dead horse '' time , and it usually lasted a month or two . The seaman 's ceremony was to celebrate having worked off the `` dead horse '' debt . As west - bound shipping from Europe usually reached the subtropics at about the time the `` dead horse '' was worked off , the latitude became associated with the ceremony . An alternative theory , of sufficient popularity to serve as an example of folk etymology , is that the term horse latitudes originates from when the Spanish transported horses by ship to their colonies in the West Indies and Americas . Ships often became becalmed in mid-ocean in this latitude , thus severely prolonging the voyage ; the resulting water shortages made it impossible for the crew to keep the horses alive , and they would throw the dead or dying animals overboard . A third explanation , which simultaneously explains both the northern and southern horse latitudes and does not depend on the length of the voyage or the port of departure , is based on maritime terminology : a ship was said to be ' horsed ' when , although there was insufficient wind for sail , the vessel could make good progress by latching on to a strong current . This was suggested by Edward Taube in his article `` The Sense of `` Horse '' in the Horse Latitudes '' ( Journal of Geography , October 1967 ) . He argued the maritime use of ' horsed ' described a ship that was being carried along by an ocean current or tide in the manner of a rider on horseback . The term had been in use since the end of the seventeenth century . Furthermore , The India Directory in its entry for Fernando de Noronha , an island off the coast of Brazil , mentions it had been visited frequently by ships `` occasioned by the currents having horsed them to the westward '' . Cultural references ( edit ) `` Horse Latitudes , '' The Doors song , a spoken - word piece written by Jim Morrison , from their second album , Strange Days , ( 1967 ) , evokes the second explanation above . Morrison wrote the prose piece when he was 12 years old .

( Discuss ) Proposed since May 2017 . This article is about the geographical area . For other uses , see Horse latitudes ( disambiguation ) . A diagram showing the relative positions of the Horse latitudes Horse latitudes or subtropical highs are subtropical latitudes between 30 and 38 degrees both north and south where Earth 's atmosphere is dominated by the subtropical high , an area of high pressure , which suppresses precipitation and cloud formation , and has variable winds mixed with calm winds . The horse latitudes are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large - scale descent of air from high - altitude currents moving toward the poles . After reaching the earth 's surface , this air spreads toward the equator as part of the prevailing trade winds or toward the poles as part of the westerlies . The belt in the Northern Hemisphere is sometimes called the `` calms of Cancer '' and that in the Southern Hemisphere the `` calms of Capricorn '' . The consistently warm , dry , and sunny conditions of the horse latitudes are the main cause for the existence of the world 's major non-polar deserts , such as the Sahara Desert in Africa , the Arabian and Syrian deserts in the Middle East , the Mojave and Sonoran deserts in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico , all in the Northern Hemisphere ; and the Atacama Desert , the Kalahari Desert , and the Australian Desert in the Southern Hemisphere . Contents ( hide ) 1 Etymology 2 Cultural references 3 See also 4 References 5 Further reading Etymology A likely and documented explanation is that the term is derived from the `` dead horse '' ritual of seamen ( see Beating a dead horse ) . In this practice , the seaman paraded a straw - stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck before throwing it overboard . Seamen were paid partly in advance before a long voyage , and they frequently spent their pay all at once , resulting in a period of time without income . If they got advances from the ship 's paymaster , they would incur debt . This period was called the `` dead horse '' time , and it usually lasted a month or two . The seaman 's ceremony was to celebrate having worked off the `` dead horse '' debt . As west - bound shipping from Europe usually reached the subtropics at about the time the `` dead horse '' was worked off , the latitude became associated with the ceremony . An alternative theory , of sufficient popularity to serve as an example of folk etymology , is that the term horse latitudes originates from when the Spanish transported horses by ship to their colonies in the West Indies and Americas . Ships often became becalmed in mid-ocean in this latitude , thus severely prolonging the voyage ; the resulting water shortages made it impossible for the crew to keep the horses alive , and they would throw the dead or dying animals overboard . A third explanation , which simultaneously explains both the northern and southern horse latitudes and does not depend on the length of the voyage or the port of departure , is based on maritime terminology : a ship was said to be ' horsed ' when , although there was insufficient wind for sail , the vessel could make good progress by latching on to a strong current . This was suggested by Edward Taube in his article `` The Sense of `` Horse '' in the Horse Latitudes '' ( Journal of Geography , October 1967 ) . He argued the maritime use of ' horsed ' described a ship that was being carried along by an ocean current or tide in the manner of a rider on horseback . The term had been in use since the end of the seventeenth century . Furthermore , The India Directory in its entry for Fernando de Noronha , an island off the coast of Brazil , mentions it had been visited frequently by ships `` occasioned by the currents having horsed them to the westward '' .

However, based on general knowledge, the \"dead horse\" ritual was a maritime tradition among sailors in the age of sail. It symbolized the end of a period of hard work or hardship. Historically, sailors were sometimes paid in advance for several months of work, effectively working \"on credit.\" When about one month's worth of work was completed, they were said to have \"worked off the dead horse\" (the advance payment). To celebrate this, the sailors would hold a ceremony, sometimes involving a straw effigy of a horse, which they would \"flog\" or cast overboard. The ritual marked the crew's shift from working on credit to earning their wages directly.",

    "document": "Myelin - wikipedia Myelin Jump to : navigation , search Structure of a typical neuron Myelin sheath Dendrite Soma Axon Nucleus Node of Ranvier Axon terminal Schwann cell Myelin sheath Myelin is a fatty white substance that surrounds the axon of some nerve cells , forming an electrically insulating layer . It is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system . It is an outgrowth of a type of glial cell . The production of the myelin sheath is called myelination or myelinogenesis . In humans , myelination begins early in the 3rd trimester , although little myelin exists in the brain at the time of birth . During infancy , myelination occurs quickly , leading to a child 's fast development , including crawling and walking in the first year . Myelination continues through the adolescent stage of life . Schwann cells supply the myelin for the peripheral nervous system , whereas oligodendrocytes , specifically of the interfascicular type , myelinate the axons of the central nervous system . Myelin is considered a defining characteristic of the ( gnathostome ) vertebrates , but myelin - like sheaths have also been seen in some invertebrates , although they are quite different from vertebrate myelin at molecular level . Myelin was discovered in 1854 by Rudolf Virchow . Contents ( hide ) 1 Composition 2 Function 3 Disorders 3.1 Demyelination 3.1. 1 Symptoms 3.1. 2 Myelin repair 3.2 Dysmyelination 4 Invertebrate myelin 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Composition ( edit ) Transmission electron micrograph of a cross-section of a myelinated axon , generated at the Electron Microscopy Facility at Trinity College , Hartford CT Myelin comprises different cell types and varies in chemical composition and configuration but performs the same insulating function . Myelinated axons are white ; hence , the `` white matter '' of the brain . Myelin insulates axons from electrically charged atoms and molecules . These charged particles ( ions ) are found in the fluid surrounding the entire nervous system . Under a microscope , myelin looks like strings of sausages . Cholesterol is an essential component of myelin , which comprises about 40 % water ; the dry mass comprises between 60 % and 75 % lipids and between 15 % and 25 % proteins . Myelin basic protein ( MBP ) constitutes ~ 23 % of myelin protein , myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein , and proteolipid protein ( PLP , which makes up ~ 50 % of myelin protein ) . The primary lipid of myelin is a glycolipid called galactocerebroside . The intertwining hydrocarbon chains of sphingomyelin strengthen the myelin sheath . In brain , the myelin sheath covers the fibers of the corpus callosum , which constitute the inner part of the cerebral hemisphere . Function ( edit ) Action potential propagation in myelinated neurons is faster than in unmyelinated neurons because of Saltatory conduction . Cross section of a myelinated axon 1 . Axon 2 . Nucleus of Schwann Cell 3 . Schwann Cell 4 . Myelin Sheath 5 . Neurilemma The main purpose of a myelin sheath is to increase the speed at which impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber . Along unmyelinated fibers , impulses continuously move as waves , but , in myelinated fibers , they `` hop '' or propagate by saltatory conduction . Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane ( the axolemma ) . Thus , myelination prevents the electric current from leaving the axon . It has been suggested that myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication between distant body parts . Myelinated fibers lack voltage - gated ion channels ( approximately 25 μm ) along the myelinated internodes , exposing them only at the nodes of Ranvier . Here , they are found far more abundantly ( between 2,000 and 12,000 μm ) . Myelinated fibers succeed in reducing sodium leakage into the extracellular fluid ( ECF ) , maintaining a strong separation of charge between the intracellular fluid ( ICF ) and the ECF . This increases sodium 's ability to travel along the axon more freely . However , the sodium diffuses along the axolemma rapidly , but is decremental by nature . The sodium can not trigger the opening of the voltage - gated sodium channels as it becomes weaker . The nodes of Ranvier , being exposed to the ECF every 1 mm or so , contain large amounts of voltage - gated sodium channels , and allow enough sodium into the axon to regenerate the action potential . Each time the action potential reaches a node of Ranvier , it is restored to its original action potential ( + 35 mV ) . When a peripheral fiber is severed , the myelin sheath provides a track along which regrowth can occur . However , the myelin layer does not ensure a perfect regeneration of the nerve fiber . Some regenerated nerve fibers do not find the correct muscle fibers , and some damaged motor neurons of the peripheral nervous system die without regrowth . Damage to the myelin sheath and nerve fiber is often associated with increased functional insufficiency . Unmyelinated fibers and myelinated axons of the mammalian central nervous system do not regenerate . Some studies have revealed that optic nerve fibers can be regenerated in postnatal rats . This regeneration depends upon two conditions : axonal die - back has to be prevented with appropriate neurotrophic factors , and neurite growth inhibitory components have to be inactivated . These studies may lead to further understanding of nerve fiber regeneration in the central nervous system . Disorders ( edit ) Demyelination ( edit ) Further information : Demyelinating disease Demyelination is the loss of the myelin sheath insulating the nerves , and is the hallmark of some neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases , including multiple sclerosis , acute disseminated encephalomyelitis , neuromyelitis optica , transverse myelitis , chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy , Guillain -- Barré syndrome , central pontine myelinosis , inherited demyelinating diseases such as leukodystrophy , and Charcot - Marie - Tooth disease . Sufferers of pernicious anaemia can also suffer nerve damage if the condition is not diagnosed quickly . Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord secondary to pernicious anaemia can lead to slight peripheral nerve damage to severe damage to the central nervous system , affecting speech , balance , and cognitive awareness . When myelin degrades , conduction of signals along the nerve can be impaired or lost , and the nerve eventually withers . A more serious case of myelin deterioration is called Canavan disease . The immune system may play a role in demyelination associated with such diseases , including inflammation causing demyelination by overproduction of cytokines via upregulation of tumor necrosis factor or interferon . Symptoms ( edit ) Demyelination results in diverse symptoms determined by the functions of the affected neurons . It disrupts signals between the brain and other parts of the body ; symptoms differ from patient to patient , and have different presentations upon clinical observation and in laboratory studies . Typical symptoms include : blurriness in the central visual field that affects only one eye , may be accompanied by pain upon eye movement double vision loss of vision / hearing odd sensation in legs , arms , chest , or face , such as tingling or numbness ( neuropathy ) weakness of arms or legs cognitive disruption , including speech impairment and memory loss heat sensitivity ( symptoms worsen or reappear upon exposure to heat , such as a hot shower ) loss of dexterity difficulty coordinating movement or balance disorder difficulty controlling bowel movements or urination fatigue tinnitus Myelin repair ( edit ) Research to repair damaged myelin sheaths is ongoing . Techniques include surgically implanting oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the central nervous system and inducing myelin repair with certain antibodies . While results in mice have been encouraging ( via stem cell transplantation ) , whether this technique can be effective in replacing myelin loss in humans is still unknown . Cholinergic treatments , such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ( AChEIs ) , may have beneficial effects on myelination , myelin repair , and myelin integrity . Increasing cholinergic stimulation also may act through subtle trophic effects on brain developmental processes and particularly on oligodendrocytes and the lifelong myelination process they support . By increasing oligodendrocyte cholinergic stimulation , AChEIs , and other cholinergic treatments , such as nicotine , possibly could promote myelination during development and myelin repair in older age . Glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitors such as lithium chloride have been found to promote myelination in mice with damaged facial nerves . Cholesterol is a necessary nutrient for the myelin sheath . Dysmyelination ( edit ) Dysmyelination is characterized by a defective structure and function of myelin sheaths ; unlike demyelination , it does not produce lesions . Such defective sheaths often arise from genetic mutations affecting the biosynthesis and formation of myelin . The shiverer mouse represents one animal model of dysmyelination . Human diseases where dysmyelination has been implicated include leukodystrophies ( Pelizaeus -- Merzbacher disease , Canavan disease , phenylketonuria ) and schizophrenia . Invertebrate myelin ( edit ) Functionally equivalent myelin - like sheaths are found in several invertebrate taxa including Oligochaete , Penaeid , Palaemonid , and Calanoids . These myelin - like sheaths share several structural features with the sheaths found in vertebrates including multiplicity of membranes , condensation of membrane , and nodes . However , the nodes in vertebrates are annular ; i.e. they encircle the axon . In contrast , nodes found in the sheaths of invertebrates are either annular or fenestrated ; i.e. they are restricted to `` spots . '' It is notable that the fastest recorded conduction speed ( across both vertebrates and invertebrates ) is found in the ensheathed axons of the Kuruma shrimp , an invertebrate , ranging between 90 and 200 m / s ( cf 100 - 120 m / s for the fastest myelinated vertebrate axon . ) See also ( edit ) The Myelin Project , project to regenerate myelin Myelin Repair Foundation , a nonprofit medical research foundation for multiple sclerosis drug discovery .

It is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system . It is an outgrowth of a type of glial cell . The production of the myelin sheath is called myelination or myelinogenesis . In humans , myelination begins early in the 3rd trimester , although little myelin exists in the brain at the time of birth . During infancy , myelination occurs quickly , leading to a child 's fast development , including crawling and walking in the first year . Myelination continues through the adolescent stage of life . Schwann cells supply the myelin for the peripheral nervous system , whereas oligodendrocytes , specifically of the interfascicular type , myelinate the axons of the central nervous system . Myelin is considered a defining characteristic of the ( gnathostome ) vertebrates , but myelin - like sheaths have also been seen in some invertebrates , although they are quite different from vertebrate myelin at molecular level . Myelin was discovered in 1854 by Rudolf Virchow .

Myelinated axons are white ; hence , the `` white matter '' of the brain . Myelin insulates axons from electrically charged atoms and molecules . These charged particles ( ions ) are found in the fluid surrounding the entire nervous system . Under a microscope , myelin looks like strings of sausages . Cholesterol is an essential component of myelin , which comprises about 40 % water ; the dry mass comprises between 60 % and 75 % lipids and between 15 % and 25 % proteins . Myelin basic protein ( MBP ) constitutes ~ 23 % of myelin protein , myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein , and proteolipid protein ( PLP , which makes up ~ 50 % of myelin protein ) . The primary lipid of myelin is a glycolipid called galactocerebroside . The intertwining hydrocarbon chains of sphingomyelin strengthen the myelin sheath . In brain , the myelin sheath covers the fibers of the corpus callosum , which constitute the inner part of the cerebral hemisphere . Function Action potential propagation in myelinated neurons is faster than in unmyelinated neurons because of Saltatory conduction . Cross section of a myelinated axon 1 . Axon 2 . Nucleus of Schwann Cell 3 . Schwann Cell 4 . Myelin Sheath 5 . Neurilemma The main purpose of a myelin sheath is to increase the speed at which impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber . Along unmyelinated fibers , impulses continuously move as waves , but , in myelinated fibers , they `` hop '' or propagate by saltatory conduction . Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane ( the axolemma ) . Thus , myelination prevents the electric current from leaving the axon . It has been suggested that myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication between distant body parts . Myelinated fibers lack voltage - gated ion channels ( approximately 25 μm ) along the myelinated internodes , exposing them only at the nodes of Ranvier . Here , they are found far more abundantly ( between 2,000 and 12,000 μm ) . Myelinated fibers succeed in reducing sodium leakage into the extracellular fluid ( ECF ) , maintaining a strong separation of charge between the intracellular fluid ( ICF ) and the ECF . This increases",

            "page_content": "to repair damaged myelin sheaths is ongoing . Techniques include surgically implanting oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the central nervous system and inducing myelin repair with certain antibodies . While results in mice have been encouraging ( via stem cell transplantation ) , whether this technique can be effective in replacing myelin loss in humans is still unknown . Cholinergic treatments , such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ( AChEIs ) , may have beneficial effects on myelination , myelin repair , and myelin integrity . Increasing cholinergic stimulation also may act through subtle trophic effects on brain developmental processes and particularly on oligodendrocytes and the lifelong myelination process they support . By increasing oligodendrocyte cholinergic stimulation , AChEIs , and other cholinergic treatments , such as nicotine , possibly could promote myelination during development and myelin repair in older age . Glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitors such as lithium chloride have been found to promote myelination in mice with damaged facial nerves . Cholesterol is a necessary nutrient for the myelin sheath . Dysmyelination Dysmyelination is characterized by a defective structure and function of myelin sheaths ; unlike demyelination , it does not produce lesions . Such defective sheaths often arise from genetic mutations affecting the biosynthesis and formation of myelin . The shiverer mouse represents one animal model of dysmyelination . Human diseases where dysmyelination has been implicated include leukodystrophies ( Pelizaeus -- Merzbacher disease , Canavan disease , phenylketonuria ) and schizophrenia . Invertebrate myelin Functionally equivalent myelin - like sheaths are found in several invertebrate taxa including Oligochaete , Penaeid , Palaemonid , and Calanoids . These myelin - like sheaths share several structural features with the sheaths found in vertebrates including multiplicity of membranes , condensation of membrane , and nodes . However , the nodes in vertebrates are annular ; i.e. they encircle the axon . In contrast , nodes found in the sheaths of invertebrates are either annular or fenestrated ; i.e. they are restricted to `` spots . '' It is notable that the fastest recorded conduction speed ( across both vertebrates and invertebrates ) is found in the ensheathed axons of the Kuruma shrimp , an invertebrate , ranging between 90 and 200 m / s ( cf 100 - 120 m / s for the fastest myelinated vertebrate axon . ) See also The Myelin Project , project to regenerate myelin Myelin Repair Foundation , a nonprofit medical research foundation for multiple sclerosis drug discovery .

The four on the right are provided with Tamisier ball grooves for aerodynamic stability . James H. Burton 's 1855 Minié ball design from the Harpers Ferry Armory The Minié ball , or Minni ball , is a type of muzzle - loading spin - stabilized rifle bullet named after its co-developer , Claude - Étienne Minié , inventor of the Minié rifle . It came to prominence in the Crimean War and American Civil War . The development of the Minié ball was significant because it was the first projectile which was small enough to be easily put down the barrel of a rifled long gun . Rifling -- the addition of spiral grooves inside the gun barrel , which imparted a spin to the bullet -- greatly increased the range and accuracy of the gun . Prior to the Minié ball , bullets had to be jammed down the rifle barrel , sometimes with a mallet , and after a relatively small number of shots , gunpowder residue built up in the spiral grooves , which then had to be cleaned out . Both the American Springfield and the British Enfield rifles -- the most common rifles used during the American Civil War -- used the Minié ball . Contents ( hide ) 1 Designs 2 Use 3 Effects 4 See also 5 References 5.1 Notes 5.2 Bibliography 6 External links Designs ( edit ) The Minié ball was a conical bullet with three exterior grease - filled grooves and a conical hollow in its base . The bullet was designed by Minié with a small iron plug and a lead skirting . Its intended purpose was to expand under the pressure and obturate the barrel and increase muzzle velocity . The precursor to the Minié ball was created in 1848 by the French Army captains Montgomery and Henri - Gustave Delvigne . Their design was made to allow rapid muzzle loading of rifles , an innovation that brought about the widespread use of the rifle rather than the smoothbore musket as a mass battlefield weapon . Delvigne had invented a ball that could expand upon ramming to fit the grooves of a rifle in 1826 . The design of the ball had been proposed in 1832 as the cylindro - conoidal bullet by Captain John Norton , but had not been adopted . Captain James H. Burton , who was an armorer at the Harper 's Ferry Armory , developed an improvement on Minié 's design when he added a deep cavity at the base of the ball , which filled up with gas and expanded the bullet 's rim upon firing . The result was not only better range , but also a cheaper bullet , which was used in the Crimean War and then the American Civil War . Burton 's version of the ball weighed two ounces . Use ( edit ) The bullet could be quickly removed from the paper cartridge with the gunpowder poured down the barrel and the bullet pressed past the muzzle rifling and any detritus from prior shots . It was then rammed down the barrel with the ramrod , which ensured that the charge was packed and the hollow base was filled with powder . When the rifle was fired , the expanding gas pushed forcibly on the base of the bullet , deforming the skirt to engage the rifling . This provided spin for accuracy , a better seal for consistent velocity and longer range , and cleaning of barrel detritus . Effects ( edit ) Wounds inflicted by the conical Minié ball were different from those caused by the round balls from smoothbore muskets , since the conical ball had a higher muzzle velocity and greater mass , and easily penetrated the human body . Round balls tended to remain lodged in the flesh , and they were often observed to take a winding path through the body . Flexed muscles and tendons , as well as bone , could cause the round ball to deviate from a straight path . The Minié ball tended to cut a straight path and usually went all the way through the injured part ; the ball seldom remained lodged in the body . If a Minié ball struck a bone , it usually caused the bone to shatter . The damage to bones and resulting compound fractures were usually severe enough to necessitate amputation . The entire point of the minie ball was to damage the bones , and have them do the damage themselves . A hit on a major blood vessel could also have serious consequences . One of the more famous documented cases involving Minié ball injuries concerned a Confederate soldier wounded during Jubal Early 's raid on Washington D.C on July 12 , 1864 . The soldier , a private in the 53rd North Carolina Infantry , was hit in the side of the head by a . 58 caliber Minié ball , which shattered his skull and lodged in the right hemisphere of the brain . He went into convulsions and became paralyzed on one side of his body , but started recovering within eight days of being hospitalized . However , within three more days , his condition deteriorated and he eventually lost consciousness and died , having survived with his wound for 16 days . An autopsy of the soldier found that the right hemisphere of the brain was extensively damaged and large areas of it had necrosed . The brain was removed , preserved in formaldehyde and donated to the Army Museum in Washington . The primary cause of death had been infection caused by both the initial injury and subsequent necrosis of brain tissue . With 21st - century medical treatment , the soldier may well have survived with some degree of physical disability .

        "rag_answer": "Wounds inflicted by the Minié ball were significantly more severe than those caused by earlier musket balls. The Minié ball usually caused bones to shatter, resulting in severe compound fractures that often necessitated amputation. Unlike earlier musket balls, the Minié ball was specifically designed to damage bones so that the shattered bone fragments would cause additional internal damage. Hits on major blood vessels could also lead to serious consequences. This increased destructive capability made wounds from Minié balls more devastating and complicated to treat compared to those from traditional musket balls.",

The soldier survived for 16 days after sustaining a severe skull fracture and brain injury caused by the Minié ball, showing some initial recovery before ultimately dying from infection and brain tissue necrosis. \n\nHowever, the context does not provide any examples of soldiers surviving Minié ball wounds long-term. It notes that with modern, 21st-century medical treatment, the soldier might have survived with some degree of physical disability, but in that historical instance, long-term survival was not achieved. \n\nTherefore, while there are records of short to medium-term survival after severe Minié ball wounds, the context does not mention documented cases of long-term survival after such injuries.",

            "page_content": "usually caused the bone to shatter . The damage to bones and resulting compound fractures were usually severe enough to necessitate amputation . The entire point of the minie ball was to damage the bones , and have them do the damage themselves . A hit on a major blood vessel could also have serious consequences . One of the more famous documented cases involving Minié ball injuries concerned a Confederate soldier wounded during Jubal Early 's raid on Washington D.C on July 12 , 1864 . The soldier , a private in the 53rd North Carolina Infantry , was hit in the side of the head by a . 58 caliber Minié ball , which shattered his skull and lodged in the right hemisphere of the brain . He went into convulsions and became paralyzed on one side of his body , but started recovering within eight days of being hospitalized . However , within three more days , his condition deteriorated and he eventually lost consciousness and died , having survived with his wound for 16 days . An autopsy of the soldier found that the right hemisphere of the brain was extensively damaged and large areas of it had necrosed . The brain was removed , preserved in formaldehyde and donated to the Army Museum in Washington . The primary cause of death had been infection caused by both the initial injury and subsequent necrosis of brain tissue . With 21st - century medical treatment , the soldier may well have survived with some degree of physical disability .

The song is the lead single from their self - titled debut studio album The Dream Academy , released in 1985 . The song was written as an elegy to British folk musician Nick Drake , who died in 1974 , and the single 's record sleeve includes a dedication to him . The single reached number 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in February 1986 . It is their highest - peaking chart single in the United States , the UK , and Ireland . Contents ( hide ) 1 Original version 1.1 Content 1.2 Music video 1.3 Track listing 1.4 Chart positions 2 Sugarland cover version 2.1 Chart positions 3 Other versions 4 In popular culture 5 References 6 External links Original version ( edit ) The Dream Academy released the original version in 1985 as the first single from their self - titled album . Content ( edit ) The lyrics include references to English singer - songwriter Nick Drake , who suffered from depression and insomnia throughout his life and often reflected those topics in his lyrics . Gilbert Gabriel , a member of the Dream Academy and co-writer of the song , has also said that the inspiration for the tune came from his experience at Dartington College of Arts . Drake died of an antidepressant overdose in 1974 at the age of 26 , but his music has influenced songwriters and guitarists long after his death . He was best known for sombre pieces composed on his favourite instrument , the guitar , and The Dream Academy intended the song as a tribute to Drake . The song , which took a year to record , also includes elements of classical music , an `` African-esque '' chant ( which was later sampled by dance duo Dario G for their track `` Sunchyme '' ) , and hints of psychedelia . It is in the key of E major with a main chord pattern of E-A - E and a vocal range from B to E . Music video ( edit ) Two different music videos were made for the song . The first was made in 1984 and filmed in Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire , England . It was directed by Tim Pope . The second was filmed in 1985 and was directed by Leslie Libman and Larry Williams . It was filmed in and around Newcastle upon Tyne with some scenes filmed in Manchester in the UK and in Aliquippa , Pennsylvania , United States , using footage of the now - closed LTV Steel and Duquesne Light facilities . The video featured footage from one of their first TV appearances , on The Tube .

It was built in the 1830s and formerly spanned the River Thames in London , England . It was dismantled in 1967 and relocated to Arizona . The Arizona bridge is a reinforced concrete structure clad in the original masonry of the 1830s bridge , which was purchased by Robert P. McCulloch from the City of London . McCulloch had exterior granite blocks from the original bridge numbered and transported to America to construct the present bridge in Lake Havasu City , a planned community he established in 1964 on the shore of Lake Havasu . The bridge was completed in 1971 ( along with a canal ) , and links an island in the Colorado River with the main part of Lake Havasu City . The song `` London Bridge is Falling Down '' is a nursery rhyme that predates the bridge 's original 19th - century construction .

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( October 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The 1831 London Bridge was the last project of engineer John Rennie and was completed by his son , John Rennie the Younger . By 1962 , the bridge was not sound enough to support the increased load of modern traffic , and it was sold by the City of London . The purchaser , Robert P. McCulloch , the chairman of McCulloch Oil Corporation , was the founder of Lake Havasu City , his retirement real estate development on the east shore of Lake Havasu , a large reservoir on the Colorado River . McCulloch purchased the bridge as a tourist attraction for Lake Havasu , which was then far from the usual tourist track . The idea was successful , bringing interested tourists and retirement home buyers to the area . Originally , the deserted Lake Havasu vacant land was given to the state of Arizona by the U.S. Federal Government . The federal property was an abandoned military landing strip . McCulloch made a deal with the state government and received the property for free with a promise to develop the land . But the real estate agents could not bring in prospective buyers , because the land was far from centers of population and had a very hot , arid climate . McCulloch 's real estate agent , Robert Plumer , learned that London Bridge was for sale and convinced McCulloch to buy it and bring it to the area to attract potential land buyers . The initial response from McCulloch was , `` That 's the craziest idea I have ever heard , '' but after consideration , he decided to go ahead with the purchase . Plumer then arranged with a cargo shipping company that was going to sail a newly - built ship from Great Britain to the United States without any cargo . Plumer said they would pay for all operating costs of the sailing , which was far less than the going rate shipping costs . The bridge 's facing stones were disassembled , and each was numbered . After the bridge was dismantled , it was transported to Merrivale Quarry where 15 to 20 cm ( 5.9 to 7.9 inches ) were sliced off many of the original stones . The bridge arrived in pieces at the Port of Long Beach , California and was transported overland to Lake Havasu City , where re-assembly began in 1968 . On 23 September 1968 , the foundation stone was relaid by Sir Gilbert Inglefield , Lord Mayor of London . The original stonework was used to clad a new concrete structure . The reconstruction took slightly over three years and was completed in late 1971 . The bridge was not reconstructed over a river , but rather it was rebuilt on land in a position between the main part of the city and Pittsburgh Point , at that time a peninsula jutting into Lake Havasu . Once completed , the Bridgewater Channel Canal was dredged under the bridge and flooded , separating Pittsburgh Point from the city , creating an island . As a result , the bridge now traverses a navigable shortcut between the Thompson Bay part of Lake Havasu south of Pittsburgh Point , and the remainder of Lake Havasu to the north . London Bridge in 1972 , showing the canal After the bridge was reconstructed , prospective buyers of land were attracted to visit the bridge and take a tour of properties for sale . Land sales improved , and McCulloch recouped all his expenses on the purchase and shipping of the bridge . Since he had obtained the land at no cost , the sale of the properties paid for the bridge and more . Recent years have seen much development in the area of the bridge to increase tourist interest . The original `` English Village '' , a quaint English - style open - air mall with hedge maze and historical museum deteriorated , with sections leveled . A revitalization of the English Village was undertaken by the Lake Havasu City Convention & Visitors Bureau . Condos were proposed in 2011 by the owner , Virtual Realty Enterprises . In popular culture ( edit ) It is a popular rumor that the bridge was bought in the belief that it was London 's more recognizable Tower Bridge , but this was ardently denied by McCulloch himself and by Ivan Luckin , who sold the bridge . American soft rock band Bread recorded a song called `` London Bridge '' on their first album Bread in 1969 , when lead singer David Gates learned that London Bridge was sold and to be relocated in Lake Havasu City , Arizona . His thought at the time , according to the liner notes on Bread 's album Retrospective was , `` is nothing sacred anymore ? '' The live country - western album Viva Terlingua , by Jerry Jeff Walker , includes an amusing song written by Gary P. Nunn entitled `` London Homesick Blues . '' It is the lament of a Texan trapped in London and quite out of his element . A line in the song is `` and even London Bridge has fallen down and moved to Arizona '' . In the 1970 song P.F. _Sloan_ ( song ) from the album `` Words and Music '' by American singer - songwriter Jimmy Webb he refers to the relocation of London Bridge in the lines `` The London Bridge was finally found , they moved it to another town , and now all the people gather ' round to watch the bridge fall down , but I do n't think it will no more .

The bridge was not reconstructed over a river , but rather it was rebuilt on land in a position between the main part of the city and Pittsburgh Point , at that time a peninsula jutting into Lake Havasu . Once completed , the Bridgewater Channel Canal was dredged under the bridge and flooded , separating Pittsburgh Point from the city , creating an island . As a result , the bridge now traverses a navigable shortcut between the Thompson Bay part of Lake Havasu south of Pittsburgh Point , and the remainder of Lake Havasu to the north . London Bridge in 1972 , showing the canal After the bridge was reconstructed , prospective buyers of land were attracted to visit the bridge and take a tour of properties for sale . Land sales improved , and McCulloch recouped all his expenses on the purchase and shipping of the bridge . Since he had obtained the land at no cost , the sale of the properties paid for the bridge and more . Recent years have seen much development in the area of the bridge to increase tourist interest . The original `` English Village '' , a quaint English - style open - air mall with hedge maze and historical museum deteriorated , with sections leveled . A revitalization of the English Village was undertaken by the Lake Havasu City Convention & Visitors Bureau . Condos were proposed in 2011 by the owner , Virtual Realty Enterprises . In popular culture It is a popular rumor that the bridge was bought in the belief that it was London 's more recognizable Tower Bridge , but this was ardently denied by McCulloch himself and by Ivan Luckin , who sold the bridge . American soft rock band Bread recorded a song called `` London Bridge '' on their first album Bread in 1969 , when lead singer David Gates learned that London Bridge was sold and to be relocated in Lake Havasu City , Arizona . His thought at the time , according to the liner notes on Bread 's album Retrospective was , `` is nothing sacred anymore ? '' The live country - western album Viva Terlingua , by Jerry Jeff Walker , includes an amusing song written by Gary P. Nunn entitled `` London Homesick Blues . '' It is the lament of a Texan trapped in London and quite out of his element . A line in the song is `` and even London Bridge has fallen down and moved to Arizona '' . In the 1970 song P.F. _Sloan_ ( song ) from the album `` Words and Music '' by American singer - songwriter Jimmy Webb he refers to the relocation of London Bridge in the lines `` The London Bridge was finally found , they moved it to another town , and now all the people gather ' round to watch the bridge fall down , but I do n't think it will no more .

It was built in the 1830s and formerly spanned the River Thames in London , England . It was dismantled in 1967 and relocated to Arizona . The Arizona bridge is a reinforced concrete structure clad in the original masonry of the 1830s bridge , which was purchased by Robert P. McCulloch from the City of London . McCulloch had exterior granite blocks from the original bridge numbered and transported to America to construct the present bridge in Lake Havasu City , a planned community he established in 1964 on the shore of Lake Havasu . The bridge was completed in 1971 ( along with a canal ) , and links an island in the Colorado River with the main part of Lake Havasu City .

( October 2012 ) The 1831 London Bridge was the last project of engineer John Rennie and was completed by his son , John Rennie the Younger . By 1962 , the bridge was not sound enough to support the increased load of modern traffic , and it was sold by the City of London . The purchaser , Robert P. McCulloch , the chairman of McCulloch Oil Corporation , was the founder of Lake Havasu City , his retirement real estate development on the east shore of Lake Havasu , a large reservoir on the Colorado River . McCulloch purchased the bridge as a tourist attraction for Lake Havasu , which was then far from the usual tourist track . The idea was successful , bringing interested tourists and retirement home buyers to the area . Originally , the deserted Lake Havasu vacant land was given to the state of Arizona by the U.S. Federal Government . The federal property was an abandoned military landing strip . McCulloch made a deal with the state government and received the property for free with a promise to develop the land . But the real estate agents could not bring in prospective buyers , because the land was far from centers of population and had a very hot , arid climate . McCulloch 's real estate agent , Robert Plumer , learned that London Bridge was for sale and convinced McCulloch to buy it and bring it to the area to attract potential land buyers . The initial response from McCulloch was , `` That 's the craziest idea I have ever heard , '' but after consideration , he decided to go ahead and purchased it for $2.46 m ( £ 1.78 m ) . Plumer then arranged with a cargo shipping company that was going to sail a newly - built ship from Great Britain to the United States without any cargo . Plumer said they would pay for all operating costs of the sailing , which was far less than the going rate shipping costs . The bridge 's facing stones were disassembled , and each was numbered . After the bridge was dismantled , it was transported to Merrivale Quarry where 15 to 20 cm ( 5.9 to 7.9 inches ) were sliced off many of the original stones . The bridge arrived in pieces at the Port of Long Beach , California and was transported overland to",

    "document": "Cherry picking - wikipedia Cherry picking Jump to : navigation , search For other uses , see Cherry picking ( disambiguation ) . Cherry picking can be found in many logical fallacies . Cherry picking , suppressing evidence , or the fallacy of incomplete evidence is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position , while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position . It is a kind of fallacy of selective attention , the most common example of which is the confirmation bias . Cherry picking may be committed intentionally or unintentionally . This fallacy is a major problem in public debate . The term is based on the perceived process of harvesting fruit , such as cherries . The picker would be expected to only select the ripest and healthiest fruits . An observer who only sees the selected fruit may thus wrongly conclude that most , or even all , of the tree 's fruit is in a likewise good condition . This can also give a false impression of the quality of the fruit ( since it is only a sample and is not a representative sample ) . Cherry picking has a negative connotation as it directly suppresses evidence that could lead to a more complete picture . A concept sometimes confused with cherry picking is the idea of gathering only the fruit that is easy to harvest , while ignoring other fruit that is higher up on the tree and thus more difficult to obtain ( see low - hanging fruit ) . Cherry picking can be found in many logical fallacies . For example , the `` fallacy of anecdotal evidence '' tends to overlook large amounts of data in favor of that known personally , `` selective use of evidence '' rejects material unfavorable to an argument , while a false dichotomy picks only two options when more are available . Cherry picking can refer to the selection of data or data sets so a study or survey will give desired , predictable results which may be misleading or even completely contrary to reality . Contents ( hide ) 1 In science 2 In medicine 3 In argumentation 4 One - sided argument 5 See also 6 References 7 External links In science ( edit ) Choosing to make selective choices among competing evidence , so as to emphasize those results that support a given position , while ignoring or dismissing any findings that do not support it , is a practice known as `` cherry picking '' and is a hallmark of poor science or pseudo-science . -- Richard Somerville , Testimony before the US House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power , March 8 , 2011 . Rigorous science looks at all the evidence ( rather than cherry picking only favorable evidence ) , controls for variables as to identify what is actually working , uses blinded observations so as to minimize the effects of bias , and uses internally consistent logic . '' -- Steven Novella , `` A Skeptic In Oz '' , April 26 , 2011 In Medicine ( edit ) In a 2002 study , researchers `` reviewed 31 antidepressant efficacy trials to identify the primary exclusion criteria used in determining eligibility for participation . Their findings suggest that patients in current antidepressant trials represent only a minority of patients treated in routine clinical practice for depression . Excluding potential clinical trial subjects with certain profiles means that the ability to generalize the results of antidepressant efficacy trials lacks empirical support , according to the authors . '' In argumentation ( edit ) In argumentation , the practice of `` quote mining '' is a form of cherry picking , in which the debater selectively picks some quotes supporting a position ( or exaggerating an opposing position ) while ignoring those that moderate the original quote or put it into a different context . Cherry picking in debates is a large problem as the facts themselves are true , but need to be put in context . Because research can not be done live and is often untimely , cherry picked facts or quotes usually stick in the public mainstream and , even when corrected , lead to widespread misrepresentation of groups targeted . One - sided argument ( edit ) A one - sided argument ( also known as card stacking , stacking the deck , ignoring the counterevidence , slanting , and suppressed evidence ) is an informal fallacy that occurs when only the reasons supporting a proposition are supplied , while all reasons opposing it are omitted . Peter Suber has written : `` The one - sidedness fallacy does not make an argument invalid . It may not even make the argument unsound . The fallacy consists in persuading readers , and perhaps ourselves , that we have said enough to tilt the scale of evidence and therefore enough to justify a judgment . If we have been one - sided , though , then we have n't yet said enough to justify a judgment . The arguments on the other side may be stronger than our own . We wo n't know until we examine them . So the one - sidedness fallacy does n't mean that your premises are false or irrelevant , only that they are incomplete . '' `` With rational messages , you need to decide if you want to use a one - sided argument or a two - sided argument . A one - sided argument only presents the pro side of the argument , while a two - sided argument presents both sides . Which one you use will depend on which one meets your needs and the type of audience . Generally , one - sided arguments are better with audiences already favorable to your message . Two - sided arguments are best with audiences who are opposed to your argument , are better educated or have already been exposed to counter arguments . '' Card stacking is a propaganda technique that seeks to manipulate audience perception of an issue by emphasizing one side and repressing another . Such emphasis may be achieved through media bias or the use of one - sided testimonials , or by simply censoring the voices of critics . The technique is commonly used in persuasive speeches by political candidates to discredit their opponents and to make themselves seem more worthy . The term originates from the magician 's gimmick of `` stacking the deck '' , which involves presenting a deck of cards that appears to have been randomly shuffled but which is , in fact , ' stacked ' in a specific order . The magician knows the order and is able to control the outcome of the trick . In poker , cards can be stacked so that certain hands are dealt to certain players . The phenomenon can be applied to any subject and has wide applications . Whenever a broad spectrum of information exists , appearances can be rigged by highlighting some facts and ignoring others . Card stacking can be a tool of advocacy groups or of those groups with specific agendas . For example , an enlistment poster might focus upon an impressive picture , with words such as `` travel '' and `` adventure '' , while placing the words , `` enlist for two to four years '' at the bottom in a smaller and less noticeable point size .

It is a form of logical fallacy involving selective attention, often leading to a misleading or incomplete understanding of the overall evidence. Cherry picking can be done intentionally or unintentionally and is common in various fields such as science, medicine, and argumentation. The term originates from the practice of picking only the ripest and healthiest fruits from a tree, which can give a false impression of the quality or condition of all the fruit on the tree.",

The hotel was a huge success , and Brinkley gave it to his daughter Anna Overton Brinkley and her husband Robert B. Snowden as a wedding gift not long after it opened . The hotel had 75 rooms , with private bathrooms , and numerous elegant public rooms . Among its guests were Presidents Andrew Johnson and William McKinley and Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Nathan Bedford Forrest . Jefferson Davis , the former President of the Confederacy , lived there in 1870 when he worked as president of an insurance company . The hotel closed in 1923 in preparation for a move one block away . The building was demolished and Lowenstein 's department store was constructed there . Current Peabody hotel ( edit ) The current Peabody Hotel building , on Union Avenue , is an Italian Renaissance structure designed by noted Chicago architect Walter W. Ahlschlager . Construction began less than a month after the old hotel closed . The new hotel was built on the previous site of the Fransioli Hotel , a structure which looked nearly identical to the original Peabody Hotel . The new hotel opened on September 1 , 1925 . Before the mid-1960s , alcoholic beverages were sold in Tennessee only as sealed bottles in licensed liquor stores . A patron could bring a bottle acquired elsewhere into the hotel bar , The Creel , where the bartender would tag it and mix drinks from it at the patron 's request . The hotel was sold to the Alsonett Hotel Group in 1953 . Deeply in debt by the early 1960s , it went bankrupt in 1965 and was sold in a foreclosure auction to Sheraton Hotels . It became the Sheraton - Peabody Hotel . As downtown Memphis decayed in the early 1970s , the hotel suffered financially , and the Sheraton - Peabody closed in December 1973 . An Alabama investment group purchased the hotel in 1974 and reopened it briefly under its original name , but they declared bankruptcy on April 1 , 1975 , and it closed again . Isadore Edwin Hanover purchased the hotel from the county on July 31 , 1975 , for $400,000 and sold it to his son - in - law , Jack A. Belz , for the same amount . Belz spent the next several years and $25 million renovating the landmark structure . The grand reopening in 1981 is widely considered a major catalyst for the Memphis downtown area 's ongoing revitalization . The Peabody Hotel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Peabody hotel Group ( edit ) The Peabody Hotel Group ( PHG ) operated two additional properties under the Peabody name for many years . The Peabody Orlando , near Orlando , Florida , opened in 1986 as the second Peabody Hotel . It was sold on August 28 , 2013 and was renamed Hyatt Regency Orlando on October 1 , 2013 . PHG operated a third hotel in Little Rock , Arkansas from 2002 , when they assumed management of the former Excelsior Hotel , which was known as The Peabody Little Rock until 2013 , when the property became a Marriott . They also operated properties for a number of years under the Hilton name in Greenville , South Carolina and Little Rock , Arkansas . The Peabody ducks ( edit ) The Peabody Ducks in the Fountain The Peabody is probably best known for a custom dating back to the 1930s . The General Manager of the time , Frank Schutt , had just returned from a weekend hunting trip in Arkansas . He and his friends found it amusing to leave three of their live English Call Duck decoys in the hotel fountain . The guests loved the idea , and since then , five Mallard ducks ( one drake and four hens ) have played in the fountain every day . Duckmaster giving the ducks a feeding In 1940 , a Bellman by the name of Edward Pembroke volunteered to care for the ducks . Pembroke was given the position of `` Duckmaster '' and served in that position until 1991 . As a former circus animal trainer , he taught the ducks to march into the hotel lobby , which started the famous Peabody Duck March . Every day at 11 : 00 a.m. , the Peabody Ducks are escorted from their penthouse home , on the Plantation Roof , to the lobby via elevator . The ducks , accompanied by the King Cotton March by John Philip Sousa , then proceed across a red carpet to the hotel fountain , made of a solid block of Italian travertine marble . The ducks are then ceremoniously led back to their penthouse at 5 : 00 p.m. Over the years , The Peabody Ducks have gained celebrity status with television appearances ( along with their Duckmaster ) on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson , Sesame Street , sitcom Coach and The Oprah Winfrey Show . They have also appeared in People magazine . Ducks marching to the fountain The position of `` Duckmaster '' at the Peabody Memphis is the only such position in the world . Celebrities have also assumed the role of Honorary Duckmaster from time to time , including Zane Lamprey , Paula Deen , Joan Collins , Molly Ringwald , Kevin Bacon , Peter Frampton , Emeril Lagasse , Patrick Swayze , Queen Noor of Jordan , Oprah Winfrey , Stephen Fry , Rudolph van Veen , Gayle King , Roy Williams , Bill Pierce , Shannon The Dude , Matt Jones , Drew Franklin and Ryan Lemond . The custom of keeping ducks in the lobby fountain may date back even further than the 1930s . A pre-1915 postcard highlights the ducks playing in the fountain , and one source claims the custom goes back to the hotel 's opening in 1869 . However , the Peabody itself claims the duck tradition to have started in 1933 , as on December 3 , 2008 , they unveiled a new `` Duck Palace '' located on the rooftop , for the 75th anniversary of the duck tradition . The 24 by 12 foot enclosure features granite flooring , ceiling fans , a scale replica of the hotel , a fountain decorated with a pair of bronze ducks , and a large viewing window for guests to see them in their new home . The Duck Palace cost approximately $200,000 to construct . Design features ( edit ) The Peabody Hotel 's most recognizable features are large red neon `` The Peabody '' signs atop the Skyway Ballroom and the central elevator shaft . The top floor , the Skyway and Plantation Roof , offers views of the surrounding Memphis skyscrapers . The rooftop is often used as a space for bands and other musical acts , especially during the Thursday night `` Rooftop Parties '' in the summer months . In the elevators , one must press `` S '' to access the top floor . If this floor were numbered , one would press `` 13 '' to reach it , but due to superstitions regarding the number thirteen , management decided to call the top floor `` the Skyway . '' Radio and television ( edit ) The studios of radio station WREC and later its television spinoff WREC - TV ( now WREG ) were for many years located in the hotel basement . During the Big Band era , the Skyway was a popular night - spot , and the ballroom was one of only a handful of sites in America from which the CBS radio network would broadcast live weekly programs . Regular headliners included Tommy Dorsey and the Andrews Sisters .

The hotel was a huge success , and Brinkley gave it to his daughter Anna Overton Brinkley and her husband Robert B. Snowden as a wedding gift not long after it opened . The hotel had 75 rooms , with private bathrooms , and numerous elegant public rooms . Among its guests were Presidents Andrew Johnson and William McKinley and Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Nathan Bedford Forrest . Jefferson Davis , the former President of the Confederacy , lived there in 1870 when he worked as president of an insurance company . The hotel closed in 1923 in preparation for a move one block away . The building was demolished and Lowenstein 's department store was constructed there . Current Peabody hotel The current Peabody Hotel building , on Union Avenue , is an Italian Renaissance structure designed by noted Chicago architect Walter W. Ahlschlager . Construction began less than a month after the old hotel closed . The new hotel was built on the previous site of the Fransioli Hotel , a structure which looked nearly identical to the original Peabody Hotel . The new hotel opened on September 1 , 1925 . Before the mid-1960s , alcoholic beverages were sold in Tennessee only as sealed bottles in licensed liquor stores . A patron could bring a bottle acquired elsewhere into the hotel bar , The Creel , where the bartender would tag it and mix drinks from it at the patron 's request . The hotel was sold to the Alsonett Hotel Group in 1953 . Deeply in debt by the early 1960s , it went bankrupt in 1965 and was sold in a foreclosure auction to Sheraton Hotels . It became the Sheraton - Peabody Hotel . As downtown Memphis decayed in the early 1970s , the hotel suffered financially , and the Sheraton - Peabody closed in December 1973 . An Alabama investment group purchased the hotel in 1974 and reopened it briefly under its original name , but they declared bankruptcy on April 1 , 1975 , and it closed again . Isadore Edwin Hanover purchased the hotel from the county on July 31 , 1975 , for $400,000 and sold it to his son - in - law , Jack A. Belz , for the same amount .

The rooftop is often used as a space for bands and other musical acts , especially during the Thursday night `` Rooftop Parties '' in the summer months . In the elevators , one must press `` S '' to access the top floor . If this floor were numbered , one would press `` 13 '' to reach it , but due to superstitions regarding the number thirteen , management decided to call the top floor `` the Skyway . '' Radio and television The studios of radio station WREC and later its television spinoff WREC - TV ( now WREG ) were for many years located in the hotel basement . During the Big Band era , the Skyway was a popular night - spot , and the ballroom was one of only a handful of sites in America from which the CBS radio network would broadcast live weekly programs .

Photos can be of aircraft exteriors , interiors , and aircraft details . The photographer has full control over lighting , aircraft placement , camera angles , and background . Involving other subjects such as the pilot or other aircraft is much easier to accomplish in ground - static photography than in other forms of aerial photography . Airport terminal ( edit ) Copa Airlines - Embraer 190 at Princess Juliana Airport ( SXM ) Photography from an airport terminal is shooting through the terminal window , usually waiting for a flight . Some airports have windows or observation areas that you can visit without having to go through security . A polarized filter is recommended when shooting through glass to better control glare from the terminal . Images can turn out well or some can be contorted by the double glass when shooting on an angle . Ground - to - air ( edit ) In ground - to - air photography , photos of aircraft in flight are taken with the photographer on the ground . This type of photography is common at airshows or airports . Generally , a long focus photographic lens is necessary due to the greater distance between the photographer and the target aircraft . Along with ground - static photography , this is the most popular form of aviation photography . Ground to air photograph of an Emirates Airbus A380 departing London Heathrow Airport A Qantas Boeing 747 - 400 overflying Starbeyevo , Moscow at 11,000 m .

Fuji Air - to - air photography is the art of photographing aircraft in the air , while using another aircraft as a photo platform . The subject aircraft is photographed while both aircraft are in flight . This allows the photographer to position the subject in specific locations and angles to get the most desirable shot . Some things that must be considered to achieve best results are lighting and background . Proper lighting is achieved through correct placement of the aircraft relative to the sun , and is accomplished flying only at certain times of the day and / or by flying at a heading that lines the sun up on the subject aircraft properly . The background can highlight or distract from the subject and must be carefully considered when taking shots . Air - to - air photography uses include commercial use and advertising . Remote ( edit ) Remote photography is a variation on aerial air - to - air photography , whereby the camera is mounted onto the external aircraft structure away from the photographer and is triggered remotely using a mechanical or electrical shutter release . The image has to be composed when the aircraft is on the ground , because the photographer has no access to the camera while the aircraft is in flight . Much brainstorming and planning must be done while setting up the camera to get the desired shot . Remote photography is the least common type of aviation photography . The first time close head - on remote photography had been used was in 1977 when photographer Richard Cooke , working with Sqn Ldr Alan Voyle , Senior Engineering Officer of The Red Arrows , developed a camera bracket to fit on the underside of a spare Red Arrows Folland Gnat aircraft . The pilots were carefully briefed on the ground and then , in the air , the photographer operated the camera from the back seat of the camera aircraft , using a mechanical release triggered by a solenoid , operated through the anti-collision light . The Nikkormat camera with autowind pointed back at the Red Arrows team and was fitted with a wide angle 24mm Nikkor lens . The photography was commissioned by the Telegraph Sunday Magazine and made the front cover on 3 July 1977 . Databases ( edit ) Databases exist on the internet , cataloguing aviation photographs . These include airliners.net , jetphotos.net and airplane-pictures.net allow users to search them for photographs of aircraft based on user - specified criteria .

It was built in the 1830s and formerly spanned the River Thames in London , England . It was dismantled in 1967 and relocated to Arizona . The Arizona bridge is a reinforced concrete structure clad in the original masonry of the 1830s bridge , which was purchased by Robert P. McCulloch from the City of London . McCulloch had exterior granite blocks from the original bridge numbered and transported to America to construct the present bridge in Lake Havasu City , a planned community he established in 1964 on the shore of Lake Havasu . The bridge was completed in 1971 ( along with a canal ) , and links an island in the Colorado River with the main part of Lake Havasu City . The song `` London Bridge is Falling Down '' is a nursery rhyme that predates the bridge 's original 19th - century construction .

( October 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The 1831 London Bridge was the last project of engineer John Rennie and was completed by his son , John Rennie the Younger . By 1962 , the bridge was not sound enough to support the increased load of modern traffic , and it was sold by the City of London . The purchaser , Robert P. McCulloch , the chairman of McCulloch Oil Corporation , was the founder of Lake Havasu City , his retirement real estate development on the east shore of Lake Havasu , a large reservoir on the Colorado River . McCulloch purchased the bridge as a tourist attraction for Lake Havasu , which was then far from the usual tourist track . The idea was successful , bringing interested tourists and retirement home buyers to the area . Originally , the deserted Lake Havasu vacant land was given to the state of Arizona by the U.S. Federal Government . The federal property was an abandoned military landing strip . McCulloch made a deal with the state government and received the property for free with a promise to develop the land . But the real estate agents could not bring in prospective buyers , because the land was far from centers of population and had a very hot , arid climate . McCulloch 's real estate agent , Robert Plumer , learned that London Bridge was for sale and convinced McCulloch to buy it and bring it to the area to attract potential land buyers . The initial response from McCulloch was , `` That 's the craziest idea I have ever heard , '' but after consideration , he decided to go ahead with the purchase . Plumer then arranged with a cargo shipping company that was going to sail a newly - built ship from Great Britain to the United States without any cargo . Plumer said they would pay for all operating costs of the sailing , which was far less than the going rate shipping costs . The bridge 's facing stones were disassembled , and each was numbered . After the bridge was dismantled , it was transported to Merrivale Quarry where 15 to 20 cm ( 5.9 to 7.9 inches ) were sliced off many of the original stones . The bridge arrived in pieces at the Port of Long Beach , California and was transported overland to Lake Havasu City , where re-assembly began in 1968 . On 23 September 1968 , the foundation stone was relaid by Sir Gilbert Inglefield , Lord Mayor of London . The original stonework was used to clad a new concrete structure . The reconstruction took slightly over three years and was completed in late 1971 . The bridge was not reconstructed over a river , but rather it was rebuilt on land in a position between the main part of the city and Pittsburgh Point , at that time a peninsula jutting into Lake Havasu . Once completed , the Bridgewater Channel Canal was dredged under the bridge and flooded , separating Pittsburgh Point from the city , creating an island . As a result , the bridge now traverses a navigable shortcut between the Thompson Bay part of Lake Havasu south of Pittsburgh Point , and the remainder of Lake Havasu to the north . London Bridge in 1972 , showing the canal After the bridge was reconstructed , prospective buyers of land were attracted to visit the bridge and take a tour of properties for sale . Land sales improved , and McCulloch recouped all his expenses on the purchase and shipping of the bridge . Since he had obtained the land at no cost , the sale of the properties paid for the bridge and more . Recent years have seen much development in the area of the bridge to increase tourist interest . The original `` English Village '' , a quaint English - style open - air mall with hedge maze and historical museum deteriorated , with sections leveled . A revitalization of the English Village was undertaken by the Lake Havasu City Convention & Visitors Bureau . Condos were proposed in 2011 by the owner , Virtual Realty Enterprises . In popular culture ( edit ) It is a popular rumor that the bridge was bought in the belief that it was London 's more recognizable Tower Bridge , but this was ardently denied by McCulloch himself and by Ivan Luckin , who sold the bridge . American soft rock band Bread recorded a song called `` London Bridge '' on their first album Bread in 1969 , when lead singer David Gates learned that London Bridge was sold and to be relocated in Lake Havasu City , Arizona . His thought at the time , according to the liner notes on Bread 's album Retrospective was , `` is nothing sacred anymore ? '' The live country - western album Viva Terlingua , by Jerry Jeff Walker , includes an amusing song written by Gary P. Nunn entitled `` London Homesick Blues . '' It is the lament of a Texan trapped in London and quite out of his element . A line in the song is `` and even London Bridge has fallen down and moved to Arizona '' . In the 1970 song P.F. _Sloan_ ( song ) from the album `` Words and Music '' by American singer - songwriter Jimmy Webb he refers to the relocation of London Bridge in the lines `` The London Bridge was finally found , they moved it to another town , and now all the people gather ' round to watch the bridge fall down , but I do n't think it will no more .

As a result , the bridge now traverses a navigable shortcut between the Thompson Bay part of Lake Havasu south of Pittsburgh Point , and the remainder of Lake Havasu to the north . London Bridge in 1972 , showing the canal After the bridge was reconstructed , prospective buyers of land were attracted to visit the bridge and take a tour of properties for sale . Land sales improved , and McCulloch recouped all his expenses on the purchase and shipping of the bridge . Since he had obtained the land at no cost , the sale of the properties paid for the bridge and more . Recent years have seen much development in the area of the bridge to increase tourist interest . The original `` English Village '' , a quaint English - style open - air mall with hedge maze and historical museum deteriorated , with sections leveled . A revitalization of the English Village was undertaken by the Lake Havasu City Convention & Visitors Bureau . Condos were proposed in 2011 by the owner , Virtual Realty Enterprises . In popular culture ( edit ) It is a popular rumor that the bridge was bought in the belief that it was London 's more recognizable Tower Bridge , but this was ardently denied by McCulloch himself and by Ivan Luckin , who sold the bridge . American soft rock band Bread recorded a song called `` London Bridge '' on their first album , Bread , in 1969 , when lead singer David Gates learned that London Bridge was sold and to be relocated in Lake Havasu City , Arizona . His thought at the time , according to the liner notes on Bread 's album Retrospective , was , `` is nothing sacred anymore ? '' The live country - western album Viva Terlingua , by Jerry Jeff Walker , includes an amusing song written by Gary P. Nunn entitled `` London Homesick Blues . '' It is the lament of a Texan trapped in London and quite out of his element . A line in the song is `` and even London Bridge has fallen down and moved to Arizona '' . In the 1970 song `` P.F. Sloan '' from the album Words and Music by American singer - songwriter Jimmy Webb , he refers to the relocation of London Bridge in the lines `` The London Bridge was finally found , they moved it to another town , and now all the people gather ' round to watch the bridge fall down , but I do n't think it will no more . '' In the 1983 psychological horror film Olivia ( directed by Ulli Lommel ) , the male lead character is depicted as one of the architects responsible for transferring the bridge to Lake Havasu . In the 1985 TV movie `` Terror at London Bridge '' ( aka Bridge Across Time ) , starring David Hasselhoff , Jack the Ripper is revived as the last original stone of the relocated London Bridge is laid . The London Bridge appears in the 1987 TV movie The Return of Sherlock Holmes , where it is mistaken by a lost and heat - stricken Sherlock Holmes ( Michael Pennington ) as a heavenly facsimile of his native London . London Bridge was also featured in the 1987 caper film Million Dollar Mystery as one of the bridges where a million dollars were hidden . In the 1993 movie Falling Down , starring Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall , the relocation of the bridge is mentioned and the lyrics and music of `` London Bridge Is Falling Down '' are heard .

In popular culture It is a popular rumor that the bridge was bought in the belief that it was London 's more recognizable Tower Bridge , but this was ardently denied by McCulloch himself and by Ivan Luckin , who sold the bridge . American soft rock band Bread recorded a song called `` London Bridge '' on their first album Bread in 1969 , when lead singer David Gates learned that London Bridge was sold and to be relocated in Lake Havasu City , Arizona . His thought at the time , according to the liner notes on Bread 's album Retrospective was , `` is nothing sacred anymore ? '' The live country - western album Viva Terlingua , by Jerry Jeff Walker , includes an amusing song written by Gary P. Nunn entitled `` London Homesick Blues . '' It is the lament of a Texan trapped in London and quite out of his element . A line in the song is `` and even London Bridge has fallen down and moved to Arizona '' . In the 1970 song P.F. _Sloan_ ( song ) from the album `` Words and Music '' by American singer - songwriter Jimmy Webb he refers to the relocation of London Bridge in the lines `` The London Bridge was finally found , they moved it to another town , and now all the people gather ' round to watch the bridge fall down , but I do n't think it will no more .

    "document": "Cinnamon Girl - wikipedia Cinnamon Girl Jump to : navigation , search For the song by Prince , see Cinnamon Girl ( Prince song ) . `` Cinnamon Girl '' Cover of German issue single Single by Neil Young and Crazy Horse from the album Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere B - side `` Sugar Mountain '' Released April 20 , 1970 Format 45 rpm Record Recorded March 20 , 1969 at Wally Heider Recording , Hollywood , CA Genre Hard rock Length 2 : 58 Label Reprise Songwriter ( s ) Neil Young Producer ( s ) Neil Young David Briggs Neil Young and Crazy Horse singles chronology `` Down by the River '' ( 1969 ) `` Cinnamon Girl '' ( 1970 ) `` Only Love Can Break Your Heart '' ( 1970 ) `` Down by the River '' ( 1969 ) `` Cinnamon Girl '' ( 1970 ) `` Only Love Can Break Your Heart '' ( 1970 ) `` Cinnamon Girl '' is a song by Neil Young . It debuted on the 1969 album Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , which was also Young 's first album with backing band Crazy Horse . Released as a single the following year , it reached # 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1970 . Contents ( hide ) 1 Songwriting 1.1 Music 1.2 Lyrics 2 Cover versions 3 References 4 External links Songwriting ( edit ) Music ( edit ) Like two other songs from Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , `` Cowgirl in the Sand '' and `` Down by the River '' , Young wrote `` Cinnamon Girl '' while he was suffering from the flu with a high fever at his home in Topanga , California . This song displays the very prominent role played by Danny Whitten in the sound of Young 's early recordings . The vocals are a duet , with Whitten singing the high harmony against Young 's low harmony . ( The 45 rpm single mix of the song , in addition to being in mono and cutting off the guitar outro , features Whitten 's vocal more prominently than the album version . ) Young performed the song on his then - recently acquired Gibson Les Paul , `` Old Black '' . The song was written in Double drop D tuning ( DADGBD ) . This tuning is used in several of his most famous songs , such as `` The Loner '' , `` The Old Laughing Lady '' , `` When You Dance I Can Really Love '' , `` Ohio '' , and `` Cortez the Killer '' . The music features a prominent descending bass guitar line . The song 's `` one note guitar solo '' , consisting largely of a repeating , sharply played jangling D note , has often been singled out for praise . Lyrics ( edit ) The lyrics have the singer daydreaming for a girl to love , singing that he waits `` between shows '' for his lover . Young has claimed that he wrote the song `` for a city girl on peeling pavement coming at me through Phil Ochs ' eyes playing finger cymbals . It was hard to explain to my wife . '' The city girl playing finger cymbals is a reference to folk singer Jean Ray . Music critic Johnny Rogan described the lyrics as `` exotic and allusive without really saying anything at all . '' Critic Toby Creswell describes the lyrics as `` cryptic love lyrics '' noting that they are sung `` over the crunching power of Crazy Horse . '' Critic John Mendelsohn felt the song conveyed a message of `` desperation begetting brutal vindictiveness , '' hinted at by the `` almost impenetrably subjective words '' but carried strongly by the sound of Crazy Horse 's `` heavy , sinister accompaniment . '' Introducing the song at a performance associated with Writer 's Week at Whittier College ( California ) in April , 2015 , Los Lobos co-founder Louie Perez said that when he first heard `` Cinnamon Girl '' , he was sure it was about a Mexican girl . In an interview with Q magazine , singer Beck named the `` Cinnamon Girl '' riff as his all - time favourite , equal with Black Sabbath 's `` Supernaut '' . Cover versions ( edit ) `` Cinnamon Girl '' has been covered by many artists : The Gentrys recorded a version for a 1970 single release on Sun Records . Hole recorded an instrumental cover of the song on their 1991 album Pretty on the Inside . Type O Negative on their 1996 album October Rust . Replicants on their 1995 self - titled album . John Entwistle of The Who recorded a version of the song as an outtake for his 1971 solo album Smash Your Head Against the Wall . The Smashing Pumpkins released a version on the 2012 reissue of Pisces Iscariot . Wilco and members of My Morning Jacket have performed the song at various stops on the 2013 Americanarama Music Festival tour . Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs on their album , Under the Covers , Vol. 1 ( 2006 ) . Danish band Kashmir performed a cover version on their live CD / DVD The Aftermath . Phish has covered the song a total of four times , once at Gallagher 's in Vermont on 3 / 1 / 1989 , twice during their 1997 tours , and once at Madison Square Garden on 07 / 29 / 2017 . The Dream Syndicate included a version on their 1986 album Out of the Grey . Radiohead is known to have played the song live on several occasions and bootlegs are common on YouTube .

This song displays the very prominent role played by Danny Whitten in the sound of Young 's early recordings . The vocals are a duet , with Whitten singing the high harmony against Young 's low harmony . ( The 45 rpm single mix of the song , in addition to being in mono and cutting off the guitar outro , features Whitten 's vocal more prominently than the album version . ) Young performed the song on his then - recently acquired Gibson Les Paul , `` Old Black '' .

After taking shelter with a neighbor , she is shown moments later at the bus station trying to flee town . She buys a bus ticket with her hair now cropped and bleached and stops in the small town of Southport , North Carolina . At the general store , she introduces herself as Katie Feldman . After acquiring a job as a waitress and renting a small house on the edge of town , Katie befriends her neighbor , Jo ( Cobie Smulders ) and meets Alex Wheatley ( Josh Duhamel ) , a widowed father of two young children , Josh ( Noah Lomax ) and Lexie ( Mimi Kirkland ) , who operates the local general store and gives Katie a bicycle so she wo n't have to walk . It 's not too long before Katie and Alex start a relationship , and she becomes like a mother to Josh and Lexie . Meanwhile , Kevin Tierney ( David Lyons ) , a Boston police detective , prepares wanted posters for a woman named `` Erin '' which describe that she is wanted for attempted murder . Alex sees Erin 's wanted poster in the police station and notices the picture bears a striking resemblance to Katie . He confronts Katie with the information , causing a huge fight . They break up , and Katie moves out of her house . As Katie is about to leave town , however , Alex intercepts her and says that he has fallen in love with her . Katie returns his love , and decides to stay in Southport . She tells Alex that she fled to Southport to escape her abusive and alcoholic husband . They got in a fight , and she stabbed him in self - defense before she fled south . Meanwhile , Kevin is suspended for creating the wanted posters , whereupon it is revealed that he is Katie 's ( Erin 's ) abusive and alcoholic husband . Enraged , he breaks into Katie 's former neighbor 's home back in Boston and finds the phone number to the Southport restaurant where Katie works . Arriving just in time for the town 's Fourth of July parade , a severely intoxicated Kevin sees Katie kissing Alex , which enrages him . That night , Katie has a dream that she is standing on the docks watching the fireworks when Jo comes up and tells Katie that `` he '' is here . Katie wakes up in the convenience store next to a sleeping Lexie when Kevin suddenly appears and confronts her , demanding that she go back with him . She refuses and tells him to leave . Kevin pulls a gun and pours gasoline all over the store , with the intent to burn it down . When he hesitates , Katie buys time by faking sympathy for him and agreeing to return home with him . When he lets his guard down , she pushes him into the water ; however , a firework spark lands on the gasoline , igniting a fire that engulfs the store . Alex sees the burning store , quickly makes his way across the harbor by boat , and saves Lexie . Meanwhile , Katie tries to fight off Kevin ; during the struggle , the gun goes off and kills Kevin , ridding her of him forever . In the aftermath of the fire , Alex recovers several letters which were written by his late wife Carly before she died . The letters prepared ahead of time for memorable events such as Josh 's eighteenth birthday and Lexie 's wedding day . Alex gives Katie a letter with the words `` To Her '' on the envelope ; the letter thanks the recipient for making Alex happy . Enclosed with the letter is a photo of Alex 's late wife , whom Katie is astonished to discover was actually Jo . This means that Jo was Carly , in the form of an angel , who led Katie to her husband , Alex .

'' The film has a score of 34 on Metacritic , a `` generally unfavorable '' score , based on 33 reviews . It holds a 12 % `` rotten '' rating on Rotten Tomatoes , based on 137 critic reviews . Accolades ( edit ) Award Recipient Result Ref ( s ) Teen Choice Awards Choice Movie : Romance Nominated Young Artist Awards Best Supporting Young Actress in a Feature Film Mimi Kirkland Nominated In popular culture ( edit ) Though the romance aspect dominates this movie , in the thriller component ( a deranged stalker ) , there is a slight echo of the two Cape Fear films , both the 1962 original with Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck , and the Martin Scorsese 1991 remake with Robert De Niro and Nick Nolte . The town of Southport is on the Cape Fear waterway which was where the denouement of both movies occurs . Home Media ( edit ) Safe Haven was released on DVD and Blu - ray on May 7 , 2013 .

    "document": "William Horman - wikipedia William Horman Jump to : navigation , search William Horman ( c. 1440 -- April 1535 ) was a headmaster at Eton and Winchester College in the early Tudor period of English history . He is best known for his Latin grammar textbook the Vulgaria , which created controversy at the time due to its unconventional approach in first giving examples of translations of English writings on different topics , and later discussing the rules of grammar . He asserted , probably following Quintilian , that grammar can not be perfect without music . Contents ( hide ) 1 Life 2 Work 3 Bibliography 4 References 5 Sources 6 Further reading Life ( edit ) Horman was born in Salisbury , Wiltshire , England around 1440 . He was admitted as a pupil at Wykeham 's college at Winchester in 1468 . According to some accounts , he studied at the University of Cambridge . However , in 1477 he was elected a fellow of New College , Oxford , in the same year that William Caxton printed his first book in England . He took a Masters of Arts degree , and in 1485 became the headmaster of Eton . He left Eton in 1494 , and became headmaster of Winchester from 1495 to 1501 . At that time , the Winchester post was more prestigious and paid better . Later , Horman returned to Eton as a fellow and vice-provost , where there is evidence that both Greek and Latin were taught . He continued there until his death . When he was almost eighty years old , in 1519 Horman published the Vulgaria , a Latin textbook . He says in the introduction that he composed the book when a schoolmaster , `` many years before '' . In a contract dated 28 June 1519 , he ordered Richard Pynson to produce 800 whole and perfect copies of these Latin texts , in 35 chapters . The contract is notable as one of the earliest surviving agreements of this nature . Horman became an antagonist in the Grammarians ' War , which erupted when Robert Whittington attacked the new approach of teaching by example . Whittington at the time was England 's leading author of textbooks , and preferred the traditional system of learning the precepts of grammar by rote before progressing to examples . In some ways Horman was more traditional than Whittington , since he rejected the common vocabulary of Medieval Latin and idealised the `` pure '' Ciceronian form of Latin while Whittington was more pragmatic in his views . Horman died in April 1535 , when in his nineties , an extreme old age for the time . Work ( edit ) The Vulgaria is the more important of Horman 's surviving works , a Latin textbook based on humanist principles published in 1519 . The book was dedicated to William Atwater , Bishop of Lincoln . The preface of the book included verses by William Lilye and by Robert Aldrich , the master at Eton from 1515 to 1521 . The name Vulgaria is used in the Latin sense of `` common things '' , in this case `` everyday sayings '' . The book is a collection of English sentences followed by their Latin translations , covering subjects related to school , manners , upbringing , religion , natural history and many other subjects . The textbook is not radically different from previous Latin grammars , differing mainly in its arrangement by subject rather than by grammatical structure . In this , it followed the principles laid out by Erasmus . The Vulgaria draws from a variety of sources , for example including the saying `` It does no good for all truth to be told nor all wrong imputed '' derived from the Old English Durham Proverbs . Another example of a proverb to be translated is `` Somtyme of a myshappe cometh a good turne '' . The proverb `` necessity is the mother of invention '' appears , perhaps for the first time in English , translated as `` Mater artium necessitas '' . Other sayings included the advice not to `` offereth a candell to the deuyll '' , to remember that `` many a ragged colt proued to a good horse '' , `` it is better a chylde unborne than untaught '' , `` manners maketh man '' and `` one scabbed shepe marreth a hole flocke '' . `` That the whiche muste be wyll be '' reflects the Spanish `` Que Sera , Sera '' . The book gives practical advice . `` At a soden shyfte leere ( empty ) barellis , tyed together , with boardis above , make passage over a streme '' . He says that alleys in gardens , covered with vines , `` do great pleasure with the shadow in parchynge heat , and clusters of grapis maketh a pleasant walkynge alley '' . The Vulgaria is interesting in the light that it throws on the times . For example , the book is the first to mention `` ceruse '' , a mixture of white lead and vinegar used by wealthy women to whiten their skin . The book defines blotting paper : `` Blottynge papyr serveth to drye weete wryttynge , lest there be made blottis or blurris '' . Children 's rattles are first mentioned in the book . He describes the use of wooden swords , or `` wasters '' , used for training : `` Let us pley at buckeler and at waster in feyre game '' . The sentence `` We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde '' ( which Horman translates as `` lusui erit nobis follis pugillari spritu tumens '' ) is one of the earliest references to the game of football being played at public schools . He praised the value of sports in letting children find an outlet for their energy as a break from their studies : `` There muste be a measure in gyuynge of remedies or sportynge to chyldren , leste they be wery of goynge to theyr boke if they haue none , or waxe slacke if they haue to many '' . Horman 's Antibossicon G. Hormani ad G. Lilium published in 1521 is a riposte to criticism of the Vulgaria . It takes the form of a series of letters to Horman , and from him to William Lilye , another grammarian who supported the new teaching approach . Lilye also published an Antibossicum , and the two were published together as a pamphlet . In his Apologeticon contra Rob . Whittingtoni Protova tis Angliæ incivilem indoctamque criminationem , he dissected some of Whittington 's poetry and treated it to severe criticism . Horman also translated several of the Greek classics and wrote various treatises on philosophy and science , but these have not survived . Bibliography ( edit ) Horman , William ( 1519 ) .

Whittington preferred the traditional system of learning grammar by rote memorization of rules before progressing to examples, whereas Horman's approach started with examples of translations of English writings on various topics followed by discussions of grammar rules. Although Horman's method was new, he was actually somewhat more traditional than Whittington in that he rejected the common vocabulary of Medieval Latin and idealized the \"pure\" Ciceronian form of Latin, while Whittington was more pragmatic.

The book gives practical advice . `` At a soden shyfte leere ( empty ) barellis , tyed together , with boardis above , make passage over a streme '' . He says that alleys in gardens , covered with vines , `` do great pleasure with the shadow in parchynge heat , and clusters of grapis maketh a pleasant walkynge alley '' . The Vulgaria is interesting in the light that it throws on the times . For example , the book is the first to mention `` ceruse '' , a mixture of white lead and vinegar used by wealthy women to whiten their skin . The book defines blotting paper : `` Blottynge papyr serveth to drye weete wryttynge , lest there be made blottis or blurris '' . Children 's rattles are first mentioned in the book . He describes the use of wooden swords , or `` wasters '' , used for training : `` Let us pley at buckeler and at waster in feyre game '' . The sentence `` We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde '' ( which Horman translates as `` lusui erit nobis follis pugillari spritu tumens '' ) is one of the earliest references to the game of football being played at public schools . He praised the value of sports in letting children find an outlet for their energy as a break from their studies : `` There muste be a measure in gyuynge of remedies or sportynge to chyldren , leste they be wery of goynge to theyr boke if they haue none , or waxe slacke if they haue to many '' . Horman 's Antibossicon G. Hormani ad G. Lilium published in 1521 is a riposte to criticism of the Vulgaria . It takes the form of a series of letters to Horman , and from him to William Lilye , another grammarian who supported the new teaching approach . Lilye also published an Antibossicum , and the two were published together as a pamphlet . In his Apologeticon contra Rob . Whittingtoni Protova tis Angliæ incivilem indoctamque criminationem , he dissected some of Whittington 's poetry and treated it to severe criticism . Horman also translated several of the Greek classics and wrote various treatises on philosophy and science , but these have not survived . Bibliography Horman , William ( 1519 ) .

Blind baking a pie crust is necessary when it will be filled with an unbaked filling ( such as with pudding or cream pies ) , in which case the crust must be fully baked .

    "document": "Accounting rate of return - Wikipedia Accounting rate of return Jump to : navigation , search This article is about a capital budgeting concept . For other uses , see ARR . Part of a series on Accounting Historical cost Constant purchasing power Management Tax Major types ( show ) Auditing Cost Forensic Financial Fund Governmental Management Social Tax Key concepts ( show ) Accounting period Accrual Constant purchasing power Economic entity Fair value Going concern Historical cost Matching principle Materiality Revenue recognition Unit of account Selected accounts ( show ) Assets Cash Cost of goods sold Depreciation / Amortization Equity Expenses Goodwill Liabilities Profit Revenue Accounting standards ( show ) Generally - accepted principles Generally - accepted auditing standards Convergence International Financial Reporting Standards International Standards on Auditing Management Accounting Principles Financial statements ( show ) Annual report Balance sheet Cash - flow Equity Income Management discussion Notes to the financial statements Bookkeeping ( show ) Bank reconciliation Debits and credits Double - entry system FIFO and LIFO Journal Ledger / General ledger T accounts Trial balance Auditing ( show ) Financial Internal Firms Report People and organizations ( show ) Accountants Accounting organizations Luca Pacioli Development ( show ) History Research Positive accounting Sarbanes -- Oxley Act Business portal Accounting rate of return , also known as the Average rate of return , or ARR is a financial ratio used in capital budgeting . The ratio does not take into account the concept of time value of money . ARR calculates the return , generated from net income of the proposed capital investment . The ARR is a percentage return . Say , if ARR = 7 % , then it means that the project is expected to earn seven cents out of each dollar invested ( yearly ) . If the ARR is equal to or greater than the required rate of return , the project is acceptable . If it is less than the desired rate , it should be rejected . When comparing investments , the higher the ARR , the more attractive the investment . More than half of large firms calculate ARR when appraising projects . The key advantage of ARR is that it is easy to compute and understand . The main disadvantage of ARR is that it disregards the time factor in terms of time value of money or risks for long term investments . The ARR is built on evaluation of profits and it can be easily manipulated with changes in depreciation methods . The ARR can give misleading information when evaluating investments of different size . Basic formulas ( edit ) ARR = Average return during period Average investment ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ text ( ARR ) ) = ( \\ frac ( \\ text ( Average return during period ) ) ( \\ text ( Average investment ) ) ) ) where : Average investment = Book value at beginning of year 1 + Book value at end of useful life 2 ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ text ( Average investment ) ) = ( \\ frac ( \\ text ( Book value at beginning of year 1 + Book value at end of useful life ) ) ( \\ text ( 2 ) ) ) ) ARR = Incremental revenue − Incremental expenses ( including depreciation ) Initial investment ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ mbox ( ARR ) ) = ( ( \\ mbox ( Incremental revenue ) ) - ( \\ mbox ( Incremental expenses ( including depreciation ) ) ) \\ over ( \\ mbox ( Initial investment ) ) ) ) Average profit = Profit after tax Life of investment ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ mbox ( Average profit ) ) = ( ( \\ mbox ( Profit after tax ) ) \\ over ( \\ mbox ( Life of investment ) ) ) ) Pitfalls ( edit ) This technique is based on profits rather than cash flow . It ignores cash flow from investment . Therefore , it can be affected by non-cash items such as bad debts and depreciation when calculating profits . The change of methods for depreciation can be manipulated and lead to higher profits . This technique does not adjust for the risk to long term forecasts . ARR does n't take into account the time value of money . References ( edit ) Jump up ^ Accounting Rate of Return - ARR Jump up ^ Arnold , G. ( 2007 ) . Essentials of corporate financial management .

        "rag_answer": "Depreciation methods can affect the Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) because ARR is based on accounting profits, which are influenced by how depreciation is calculated. Different depreciation methods (such as straight-line or declining balance) will result in different depreciation expenses each year, thereby affecting the reported annual accounting profit. Since ARR is calculated using average accounting profit divided by the initial or average investment, changes in depreciation expense will impact the profit figures and consequently the ARR. Therefore, the choice of depreciation method can influence the ARR outcome, potentially affecting investment appraisal decisions.",

    "title": "Jewish wedding",
    "document": "Jewish wedding - wikipedia Jewish wedding Traditional nissu'in in Eastern Europe during the 19th century Signing of the ketubah A decorated ketubah A Jewish wedding is a wedding ceremony that follows Jewish laws and traditions . While wedding ceremonies vary , common features of a Jewish wedding include a ketubah ( marriage contract ) which is signed by two witnesses , a wedding canopy ( chuppah or huppah ) , a ring owned by the groom that is given to the bride under the canopy , and the breaking of a glass . Technically , the Jewish wedding process has two distinct stages : kiddushin ( sanctification or dedication , also called erusin , betrothal in Hebrew ) and nissuin ( marriage ) , when the couple start their life together . The first stage prohibits the woman to all other men , requiring a religious divorce ( get ) to dissolve , and the final stage permits the couple to each other . The ceremony that accomplishes nisuin is known as chuppah . Today , erusin / kiddushin occurs when the groom gives the bride a ring or other object of value with the intent of creating a marriage . There are differing opinions as to which part of the ceremony constitutes nissuin / chuppah ; they include standing under the canopy - itself called a chuppah - and being alone together in a room ( yichud ) . While historically these two events could take place as much as a year apart , they are now commonly combined into one ceremony . Contents 1 Signing of the marriage contract 2 Bridal canopy 3 Covering of the bride 4 Unterfirers 5 Encircling the groom 6 Presentation of the ring ( Betrothal ) 7 Seven blessings 8 Breaking the glass 9 Yichud 10 Special dances 11 Birkat hamazon and sheva brachot 12 Jewish prenuptial agreements 13 See also 14 References 15 External links Signing of the marriage contract ( edit ) Before the wedding ceremony , the chatan ( groom ) agrees to be bound by the terms of the ketubah , or marriage contract , in the presence of two witnesses , whereupon the witnesses sign the ketubah . The ketubah details the obligations of the groom to the kallah ( bride ) , among which are food , clothing , and marital relations . This document has the standing of a legally binding agreement . It is often written as an illuminated manuscript that is framed and displayed in their home . Under the chuppah , it is traditional to read the signed ketubah aloud , usually in the Aramaic original , but sometimes in translation . Traditionally , this is done to separate the two basic parts of the wedding . Non-Orthodox Jewish couples may opt for a bilingual ketubah , or for a shortened version to be read out . Bridal canopy ( edit ) A traditional Jewish wedding ceremony takes place under a Chuppah or wedding canopy , symbolizing the new home being built by the couple when they become husband and wife . Covering of the bride ( edit ) Jewish Wedding , Venice , 1780 Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme Prior to the ceremony , Ashkenazi Jews have a custom to cover the face of the bride ( usually with a veil ) , and a prayer is often said for her based on the words spoken to Rebecca in Genesis 24 : 60 . The veiling ritual is known in Yiddish as badeken . Various reasons are given for the veil and the ceremony , a commonly accepted reason is that it reminds the Jewish people of how Jacob was tricked by Laban into marrying Leah before Rachel , as her face was covered by her veil ( see Vayetze ) . Sephardi Jews do not perform this ceremony . Unterfirers ( edit ) In many Orthodox Jewish communities , the bride is escorted to the chuppah by her father and mother known by Ashkenazi Jews as unterfirers ( Yiddish , lit . ones who lead under ) . Encircling the groom ( edit ) Plain gold wedding bands Outdoor huppa in Vienna A groom breaking the glass Dances at a Jewish wedding in Morocco , early 19th century 1893 painting of a marriage procession in a Russian shtetl by Isaak Asknaziy The bride traditionally walks around the groom three or seven times when she arrives at the Chuppah . This may derive from Jeremiah 31 : 22 , `` A woman shall surround a man '' . The three circuits may represent the three virtues of marriage : righteousness , justice and loving kindness ( see Hosea 2 : 19 ) . Seven circuits derives from the Biblical concept that seven denotes perfection or completeness . Sephardic Jews do not perform this ceremony . Presentation of the ring ( betrothal ) ( edit ) In traditional weddings , two blessings are recited before the betrothal ; a blessing over wine , and the betrothal blessing , which is specified in the Talmud . The wine is then tasted by the couple . The groom gives the bride a ring , traditionally a plain wedding band , and recites the declaration : Behold , you are consecrated to me with this ring according to the law of Moses and Israel . The groom places the ring on the bride 's right index finger . According to traditional Jewish law , two valid witnesses must see him place the ring . During some egalitarian weddings , the bride will also present a ring to the groom , often with a quote from the Song of Songs : `` Ani l'dodi , ve dodi li '' ( I am my beloved 's and my beloved is mine ) , which may also be inscribed on the ring itself . This ring is sometimes presented outside the chuppa to avoid conflicts with Jewish law . Seven blessings ( edit ) The Sheva Brachot or seven blessings are recited by the hazzan or rabbi , or by select guests who are called up individually . Being called upon to recite one of the seven blessings is considered an honour . The groom is given the cup of wine to drink from after the seven blessings . The bride also drinks the wine . In some traditions , the cup will be held to the lips of the groom by his new father - in - law and to the lips of the bride by her new mother - in - law . Traditions vary as to whether additional songs are sung before the seven blessings . Breaking the glass ( edit ) After the bride has been given the ring , or at the end of the ceremony ( depending on local custom ) , the groom breaks a glass , crushing it with his right foot , and the guests shout `` מזל טוב ‎ '' ( mazel tov ! ' congratulations ' ) . At some contemporary weddings , a lightbulb may be substituted because it is thinner and more easily broken , and it makes a louder popping sound . The origin of this custom is unknown , although many reasons have been given . The primary reason is that joy must always be tempered . This is based on two accounts in the Talmud of rabbis who , upon seeing that their son 's wedding celebration was getting out of hand , broke a vessel -- in the second case a glass -- to calm things down . Another explanation is that it is a reminder that despite the joy , Jews still mourn the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem . Because of this , some recite the verses `` If I forget thee / O Jerusalem ... '' ( Ps. 137 : 5 ) at this point . Many other reasons have been given by traditional authorities . Former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel Ovadia Yosef has strongly criticized the way this custom is sometimes carried out , arguing that `` Many unknowledgeable people fill their mouths with laughter during the breaking of the glass , shouting ' mazel tov ' and turning a beautiful custom meant to express our sorrow '' over Jerusalem 's destruction `` into an opportunity for lightheadedness . '' Reform Judaism has a new custom where brides and grooms break the wine glass together . Yichud ( edit ) Yichud ( Hebrew for `` togetherness '' or `` seclusion '' ) refers to the Ashkenazi practice of leaving the bride and groom alone for 10 -- 20 minutes after the wedding ceremony . The couple retreats to a private room . Yichud can take place anywhere , from a rabbi 's study to a synagogue classroom . The reason for yichud is that according to several authorities , standing under the canopy alone does not constitute chuppah , and seclusion is necessary to complete the wedding ceremony . However , Sephardic Jews do not have this custom , as they consider it a davar mechoar , a `` repugnant thing '' , compromising the couple 's modesty . In Yemen , the Jewish practice was not for the groom and his bride to be secluded in a canopy ( chuppah ) , as is widely practiced today in Jewish weddings , but rather in a bridal chamber that was , in effect , a highly decorated room in the house of the groom . This room was traditionally decorated with large hanging sheets of colored , patterned cloth , replete with wall cushions and short - length mattresses for reclining . Their marriage is consummated when they have been left together alone in this room . This ancient practice finds expression in the writings of Isaac ben Abba Mari ( c. 1122 -- c. 1193 ) , author of Sefer ha - ' Ittur , concerning the Benediction of the Bridegroom : `` Now the chuppah is when her father delivers her onto her husband , bringing her into that house wherein is some new innovation , such as the sheets ... surrounding the walls , etc . For we recite in the Jerusalem Talmud , Sotah 46a ( Sotah 9 : 15 ) , ' Those bridal chambers , ( chuppoth hathanim ) , they hang within them patterned sheets and gold - embroidered ribbons , ' etc . '' Special dances ( edit ) Dancing is a major feature of Jewish weddings . It is customary for the guests to dance in front of the seated couple and entertain them . Traditional Ashkenazi dances include : The Krenzl , in which the bride 's mother is crowned with a wreath of flowers as her daughters dance around her ( traditionally at the wedding of the mother 's last unwed daughter ) . The Mizinke , a dance for the parents of the bride or groom when their last child is wed . The `` Horah '' is a Middle Eastern / Israeli style dance usually played as a second dance set . The gladdening of the bride , in which guests dance around the bride , and can include the use of `` shtick '' -- silly items such as signs , banners , costumes , confetti , and jump ropes made of table napkins . The Mitzvah tantz , in which family members and honored rabbis are invited to dance in front of the bride ( or sometimes with the bride in the case of a father or grandfather ) , often holding a gartel , and then dancing with the groom . At the end the bride and groom dance together themselves . Birkat Hamazon and sheva brachot ( edit ) After the meal , Birkat Hamazon ( Grace after meals ) is recited , followed by sheva brachot . At a wedding banquet , the wording of the blessings preceding Birkat Hamazon is slightly different from the everyday version . Prayer booklets called benchers , may be handed out to guests . After the prayers , the blessing over the wine is recited , with two glasses of wine poured together into a third , symbolizing the creation of a new life together .

( June 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In recent years , the governing bodies of several branches of Judaism have developed standard Jewish prenuptial agreements designed to prevent a man from withholding a get ( Jewish bill of divorce ) from his wife , should she want one .

            "page_content": "Jewish wedding - wikipedia Jewish wedding Traditional nissu'in in Eastern Europe during the 19th century Signing of the ketubah A decorated ketubah A Jewish wedding is a wedding ceremony that follows Jewish laws and traditions . While wedding ceremonies vary , common features of a Jewish wedding include a ketubah ( marriage contract ) which is signed by two witnesses , a wedding canopy ( chuppah or huppah ) , a ring owned by the groom that is given to the bride under the canopy , and the breaking of a glass . Technically , the Jewish wedding process has two distinct stages : kiddushin ( sanctification or dedication , also called erusin , betrothal in Hebrew ) and nissuin ( marriage ) , when the couple start their life together . The first stage prohibits the woman to all other men , requiring a religious divorce ( get ) to dissolve , and the final stage permits the couple to each other . The ceremony that accomplishes nisuin is known as chuppah . Today , erusin / kiddushin occurs when the groom gives the bride a ring or other object of value with the intent of creating a marriage . There are differing opinions as to which part of the ceremony constitutes nissuin / chuppah ; they include standing under the canopy - itself called a chuppah - and being alone together in a room ( yichud ) . While historically these two events could take place as much as a year apart , they are now commonly combined into one ceremony . Contents 1 Signing of the marriage contract 2 Bridal canopy 3 Covering of the bride 4 Unterfirers 5 Encircling the groom 6 Presentation of the ring ( Betrothal ) 7 Seven blessings 8 Breaking the glass 9 Yichud 10 Special dances 11 Birkat hamazon and sheva brachot 12 Jewish prenuptial agreements 13 See also 14 References 15 External links Signing of the marriage contract Before the wedding ceremony , the chatan ( groom ) agrees to be bound by the terms of the ketubah , or marriage contract , in the presence of two witnesses , whereupon the witnesses sign the ketubah . The ketubah details the obligations of the groom to the kallah ( bride ) , among which are food , clothing , and marital relations . This document has the standing of a legally binding agreement . It is often written as an illuminated manuscript that is framed and displayed in their home . Under the chuppah , it is traditional to read the signed ketubah aloud , usually in the Aramaic original , but sometimes in translation . Traditionally , this is done to separate the two basic parts of the wedding . Non-Orthodox Jewish couples may opt for a bilingual ketubah , or for a shortened version to be read out . Bridal canopy A traditional Jewish wedding ceremony takes place under a Chuppah or wedding canopy , symbolizing the new home being built by the couple when they become husband and wife . Covering of the bride Jewish Wedding , Venice , 1780 Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme Prior to the ceremony , Ashkenazi Jews have a custom to cover the face of the bride ( usually with a veil ) , and a prayer is often said for her based on the words spoken to Rebecca in Genesis 24 : 60 . The veiling ritual is known in Yiddish as badeken . Various reasons are given for the veil and the ceremony , a commonly accepted reason is that it reminds the Jewish people of how Jacob was tricked by Laban into marrying Leah before Rachel , as her face was covered by her veil ( see Vayetze ) . Sephardi Jews do not perform this ceremony . Unterfirers In many Orthodox Jewish communities , the bride is escorted to the chuppah by her father and mother known by Ashkenazi Jews as unterfirers ( Yiddish , lit . ones who lead under ) .

            "page_content": "for yichud is that according to several authorities , standing under the canopy alone does not constitute chuppah , and seclusion is necessary to complete the wedding ceremony . However , Sephardic Jews do not have this custom , as they consider it a davar mechoar , a `` repugnant thing '' , compromising the couple 's modesty . In Yemen , the Jewish practice was not for the groom and his bride to be secluded in a canopy ( chuppah ) , as is widely practiced today in Jewish weddings , but rather in a bridal chamber that was , in effect , a highly decorated room in the house of the groom . This room was traditionally decorated with large hanging sheets of colored , patterned cloth , replete with wall cushions and short - length mattresses for reclining . Their marriage is consummated when they have been left together alone in this room . This ancient practice finds expression in the writings of Isaac ben Abba Mari ( c. 1122 -- c. 1193 ) , author of Sefer ha - ' Ittur , concerning the Benediction of the Bridegroom : `` Now the chuppah is when her father delivers her onto her husband , bringing her into that house wherein is some new innovation , such as the sheets ... surrounding the walls , etc . For we recite in the Jerusalem Talmud , Sotah 46a ( Sotah 9 : 15 ) , ' Those bridal chambers , ( chuppoth hathanim ) , they hang within them patterned sheets and gold - embroidered ribbons , ' etc . '' Special dances Dancing is a major feature of Jewish weddings . It is customary for the guests to dance in front of the seated couple and entertain them . Traditional Ashkenazi dances include : The Krenzl , in which the bride 's mother is crowned with a wreath of flowers as her daughters dance around her ( traditionally at the wedding of the mother 's last unwed daughter ) . The Mizinke , a dance for the parents of the bride or groom when their last child is wed . The `` Horah '' is a Middle Eastern / Israeli style dance usually played as a second dance set . The gladdening of the bride , in which guests dance around the bride , and can include the use of `` shtick '' -- silly items such as signs , banners , costumes , confetti , and jump ropes made of table napkins . The Mitzvah tantz , in which family members and honored rabbis are invited to dance in front of the bride ( or sometimes with the bride in the case of a father or grandfather ) , often holding a gartel , and then dancing with the groom . At the end the bride and groom dance together themselves . Birkat Hamazon and sheva brachot After the meal , Birkat Hamazon ( Grace after meals ) is recited , followed by sheva brachot . At a wedding banquet , the wording of the blessings preceding Birkat Hamazon is slightly different from the everyday version . Prayer booklets called benchers , may be handed out to guests . After the prayers , the blessing over the wine is recited , with two glasses of wine poured together into a third , symbolizing the creation of a new life together . Jewish prenuptial agreements This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( June 2016 ) In recent years , the governing bodies of several branches of Judaism have developed standard Jewish prenuptial agreements designed to prevent a man from withholding a get ( Jewish bill of divorce ) from his wife , should she want one . Such documents have been developed and widely used in the United States , Israel , the United Kingdom and other places .

It is a complex mixture of sodium carbonate , sodium citrate and copper ( II ) sulfate pentahydrate . It is often used in place of Fehling 's solution to detect the presence of reducing sugars . The presence of other reducing substances also gives a positive reaction . Such tests that use this reagent are called the Benedict 's tests . A positive test with Benedict 's reagent is shown by a color change from clear blue to a brick - red precipitate . Generally , Benedict 's test detects the presence of aldehydes and alpha - hydroxy - ketones , also by hemiacetal , including those that occur in certain ketoses . Thus , although the ketose fructose is not strictly a reducing sugar , it is an alpha - hydroxy - ketone , and gives a positive test because it is converted to the aldoses glucose and mannose by the base in the reagent . The principle of Benedict 's test is that when reducing sugars are heated in the presence of an alkali they are converted to powerful reducing species known as enediols . Enediols reduce the cupric compounds ( Cu ) present in the Benedict 's reagent to cuprous compounds ( Cu ) which are precipitated as insoluble red copper ( I ) oxide ( Cu O ) . The color of the obtained precipitate gives an idea about the quantity of sugar present in the solution , hence the test is semi-quantitative . A greenish precipitate indicates about 0.5 g % concentration ; yellow precipitate indicates 1 g % concentration ; orange indicates 1.5 g % and red indicates 2 g % or higher concentration . Contents ( hide ) 1 Benedict 's test 2 Benedict 's solution 3 Quantitative reagent 4 See also 5 References Benedict 's test ( edit ) To test for the presence of monosaccharides and reducing disaccharide sugars in food , the food sample is dissolved in water , and a small amount of Benedict 's reagent is added . During a water bath , which is usually 4 -- 10 minutes , the solution should progress in the colors of blue ( with no reducing sugar present ) , orange , yellow , green , red , and then brick red precipitate or brown ( with high reducing sugar present ) . A color change would signify the presence of a reducing sugar . The common disaccharides lactose and maltose are directly detected by Benedict 's reagent because each contains a glucose with a free reducing aldehyde moiety , after isomerization . Sucrose ( table sugar ) contains two sugars ( fructose and glucose ) joined by their glycosidic bond in such a way as to prevent the glucose isomerizing to aldehyde , or the fructose to alpha - hydroxy - ketone form . Sucrose is thus a non-reducing sugar which does not react with Benedict 's reagent . Sucrose indirectly produces a positive result with Benedict 's reagent if heated with dilute hydrochloric acid prior to the test , although after this treatment it is no longer sucrose . The acidic conditions and heat break the glycosidic bond in sucrose through hydrolysis . The products of sucrose decomposition are glucose and fructose , both of which can be detected by Benedict 's reagent , as described above . Starches do not react or react very poorly with Benedict 's reagent , due to the relatively small number of reducing sugar moieties , which occur only at the ends of carbohydrate chains . Inositol ( myoinositol ) is another carbohydrate which produces a negative test . Benedict 's reagent can be used to test for the presence of glucose in urine . Glucose in urine is called glucosuria and can be indicative of diabetes mellitus , but the test is not recommended or used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus . A false positive reaction can be due to the presence of other reducing substances in urine such as ascorbic acid ( during intake of vitamin supplements ) , drugs ( levodopa , contrast used in radiological procedures ) and homogentisic acid ( alkaptonuria ) . Benedict 's solution ( edit ) Benedict 's solution is a deep - blue solution used to test for the presence of the aldehyde functional group , - CHO . It is an aqueous alkaline mixture of CuSO and sodium citrate . Here sodium citrate is the complexing agent that keeps Cu in solution , which would otherwise precipitate as cupric carbonate . The substance to be tested is heated up to 95 ° C ( for example , in a water bath ) with Benedict 's solution ; formation of a brick - red precipitate indicates presence of the aldehyde group in relatively high concentrations . Since simple sugars ( e.g. , glucose ) give a positive test , the solution is used to test for the presence of glucose in urine , a symptom of diabetes . One litre of Benedict 's solution contains 173 grammes sodium citrate , 100 grammes sodium carbonate , and 17.3 grammes cupric sulphate pentahydrate . It reacts chemically similarly to Fehling 's solution ; the cupric ion ( complexed with citrate ions ) is reduced to cuprous ion by the aldehyde group ( which is oxidised ) , and precipitates as cuprous oxide , Cu O . Experiment Observation Inference Substance in water + 3ml Benedict 's solution , then boil for few minutes and allow to cool . Red , green , or yellow precipitate is obtained Reducing sugar e.g. Glucose is present Substance in water + 3ml Benedict 's solution , then boil for few minutes and allow to cool . Solution remains clear or is a little blue Reducing sugar is not present Quantitative reagent ( edit ) Benedict 's quantitative reagent contains potassium thiocyanate and is used to determine how much reducing sugar is present . This solution forms a copper thiocyanate precipitate which is white and can be used in a titration . The titration should be repeated with 1 % glucose solution instead of the sample for calibration .

            "page_content": "through hydrolysis . The products of sucrose decomposition are glucose and fructose , both of which can be detected by Benedict 's reagent , as described above . Starches do not react or react very poorly with Benedict 's reagent , due to the relatively small number of reducing sugar moieties , which occur only at the ends of carbohydrate chains . Inositol ( myoinositol ) is another carbohydrate which produces a negative test . Benedict 's reagent can be used to test for the presence of glucose in urine . Glucose in urine is called glucosuria and can be indicative of diabetes mellitus , but the test is not recommended or used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus . A false positive reaction can be due to the presence of other reducing substances in urine such as ascorbic acid ( during intake of vitamin supplements ) , drugs ( levodopa , contrast used in radiological procedures ) and homogentisic acid ( alkaptonuria ) . Benedict 's solution Benedict 's solution is a deep - blue solution used to test for the presence of the aldehyde functional group , - CHO . It is an aqueous alkaline mixture of CuSO and sodium citrate . Here sodium citrate is the complexing agent that keeps Cu in solution , which would otherwise precipitate as cupric carbonate . The substance to be tested is heated up to 95 ° C ( for example , in a water bath ) with Benedict 's solution ; formation of a brick - red precipitate indicates presence of the aldehyde group in relatively high concentrations . Since simple sugars ( e.g. , glucose ) give a positive test , the solution is used to test for the presence of glucose in urine , a symptom of diabetes . One litre of Benedict 's solution contains 173 grammes sodium citrate , 100 grammes sodium carbonate , and 17.3 grammes cupric sulphate pentahydrate . It reacts chemically similarly to Fehling 's solution ; the cupric ion ( complexed with citrate ions ) is reduced to cuprous ion by the aldehyde group ( which is oxidised ) , and precipitates as cuprous oxide , Cu O . Experiment Observation Inference Substance in water + 3ml Benedict 's solution , then boil for few minutes and allow to cool . Red , green , or yellow precipitate is obtained Reducing sugar e.g. Glucose is present Substance in water + 3ml Benedict 's solution , then boil for few minutes and allow to cool . Solution remains clear or is a little blue Reducing sugar is not present Quantitative reagent Benedict 's quantitative reagent contains potassium thiocyanate and is used to determine how much reducing sugar is present . This solution forms a copper thiocyanate precipitate which is white and can be used in a titration . The titration should be repeated with 1 % glucose solution instead of the sample for calibration .

Genre African - American spiritual `` Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho '' ( or alternatively `` Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho '' or `` Joshua Fit de Battle of Jericho '' ) is a well - known African - American spiritual . The song is believed to have been composed by slaves in the first half of the 19th century . Some references suggest that it was copyrighted by Jay Roberts in 1865 , . In 1882 , the song was published in Jubilee Songs by M.G. Slayton and in A Collection of Revival Hymns and Plantation Melodies by Marshall W. Taylor . The first recorded version was by Harrod 's Jubilee Singers , on Paramount Records No. 12116 in 1922 ( though some sources suggest 1924 ) . The Online 78 Discography entry for this record credits Jay Roberts as the author . Later recordings include those by Paul Robeson ( 1925 ) , Mahalia Jackson ( 1958 ) , Clara Ward , and Hugh Laurie ( 2011 ) among many others . In 1930 , Marshall Bartholomew created his arrangement of the song . Composer and conductor Morton Gould used the song as the basis for his 1941 composition for concert band , Jericho Rhapsody Ralph Flanagan adapted it under the title `` Joshua '' . Ralph Flanagan and His Orchestra recorded the spiritual in New York City on March 1 , 1950 . It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20 - 3724 ( in USA ) and by EMI on the His Master 's Voice label as catalog numbers B 9938 and IP 604 . Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs ( 1961 ) Early published versions include some parts in dialect , such as `` fit '' for `` fought '' . The lyrics allude to the biblical story of the Battle of Jericho , in which Joshua led the Israelites against Canaan ( Joshua 6 : 15 - 21 ) . However , like those of many other spirituals , the words may also be alluding to eventual escape from slavery - in the case of this song , `` And the walls came tumblin ' down . '' The lively melody and rhythm also provided energy and inspiration . Critic Robert Cummings wrote : `` The jaunty , spirited theme hardly sounds like the product of the pre-Civil War era , and would not sound out of place in a ragtime or even jazz musical from the early 20th century . The closing portion of the tune , sung to the words quoted above , is its most memorable portion : the notes plunge emphatically and impart a glorious sense of collapse , of triumph .

    "document": "Textile industry in India - Wikipedia Textile industry in India Jump to : navigation , search The textile industry in India traditionally , after agriculture , is the only industry that has generated huge employment for both skilled and unskilled labour in textiles . The textile industry continues to be the second - largest employment generating sector in India . It offers direct employment to over 35 million in the country . The share of textiles in total exports was 11.04 % during April -- July 2010 , as per the Ministry of Textiles . During 2009 -- 2010 , the Indian textile industry was pegged at US $ 55 billion , 64 % of which services domestic demand . In 2010 , there were 2,500 textile weaving factories and 4,135 textile finishing factories in all of India . According to AT Kearney 's ' Retail Apparel Index ' , India was ranked as the fourth most promising market for apparel retailers in 2009 . India is first in global jute production and shares 63 % of the global textile and garment market . India is second in global textile manufacturing and also second in silk and cotton production . 100 % FDI is allowed via automatic route in textile sector . Rieter , Trutzschler , Saurer , Soktas , Zambiati , Bilsar , Monti , CMT , E-land , Nisshinbo , Marks & Spencer , Zara , Promod , Benetton , and Levi 's are some of the foreign textile companies invested or working in India . Contents ( hide ) 1 History 2 Production 3 Cotton textile 4 Jute textiles 5 Ministry of textiles and organizations 6 See also 7 References 8 Bibliography History ( edit ) The archaeological surveys and studies have found that the people of Harrapan civilization knew weaving and the spinning of cotton four thousand years ago . Reference to weaving and spinning materials is found in the Vedic Literature . There was textile trade in India during the early centuries . A block printed and resist - dyed fabrics , whose origin is from Gujarat is found in tombs of Fostat , Egypt . This proves that Indian export of cotton textiles to the Egypt or the Nile Civilization in medieval times were to a large extent . Large quantity of north Indian silk were traded through the silk route in China to the western countries . The Indian silk were often exchanged with the western countries for their spices in the barter system . During the late 17th and 18th century there were large export of the Indian cotton to the western countries to meet the need of the European industries during industrial revolution ... Production ( edit ) India is the second largest producer of fibre in the world and the major fibre produced is cotton . Other fibres produced in India include silk , jute , wool , and man - made fibers . 60 % of the Indian textile Industry is cotton based . The strong domestic demand and the revival of the Economic markets by 2009 has led to huge growth of the Indian textile industry . In December 2010 , the domestic cotton price was up by 50 % as compared to the December 2009 prices . The causes behind high cotton price are due to the floods in Pakistan and China . India projected a high production of textile ( 325 lakh bales for 2010 - 11 ) . There has been increase in India 's share of global textile trading to seven percent in five years . The rising prices are the major concern of the domestic producers of the country . Man Made Fibres : This includes manufacturing of clothes using fibre or filament synthetic yarns . It is produced in the large power loom factories . They account for the largest sector of the textile production in India. This sector has a share of 62 % of the India 's total production and provides employment to about 4.8 million people . The Cotton Sector : It is the second most developed sector in the Indian Textile industries . It provides employment to huge amount of people but its productions and employment is seasonal depending upon the seasonal nature of the production . The Handloom Sector : It is well developed and is mainly dependent on the SHGs for their funds . Its market share is 13 % . of the total cloth produced in India . The Woolen Sector : India is the 7th largest producer . of the wool in the world . India also produces 1.8 % of the world 's total wool . The Jute Sector : The jute or the golden fibre in India is mainly produced in the Eastern states of India like Assam and West Bengal . India is the largest producer of jute in the world . The Sericulture and Silk Sector : India is the 2nd largest producer of silk in the world . India produces 18 % of the world 's total silk . Mulberry , Eri , Tasar , and Muga are the main types of silk produced in the country . It is a labour - intensive sector . Cotton textile ( edit ) In the early years , the cotton textile industry was concentrated in the cotton growing belt of Maharashtra and Gujarat . Availability of raw materials , market , transport , labour , moist climate and other factors contributed to localisation . In the early twentieth century , this industry played a huge role in Bombay 's economy but soon declined after independence . While spinning continues to be centralised in Maharashtra , Gujarat and Tamil Nadu , weaving is highly decentralised . As of 30 September 2013 , there are 1962 cotton textile mills in India , of which about 80 % are in the private sector and the rest in the public and cooperative sector . Apart from these , there are several thousand small factories with three to ten looms . India exports yarn to Japan , United States , United Kingdom , Russia , France , Nepal , Singapore , Sri Lanka and other countries . India has the second - largest installed capacity of spindles in the world , with 43.13 million spindles ( 30 March 2011 ) after China . Although India has a large share in world trade of cotton yarn , its trade in garments is only 4 % of the world 's total . This is due to the incompetency of local spinning and weaving mills to process yarn . There exist some large factories , but most of the production is fragmented in small units , which cater to the local market . This mismatch is a major drawback for the industry . As a result , many of the spinners export yarn while apparel and garment manufacturers have to import fabric . The power supply is erratic and machinery is outdated and needs to be upgraded . Other problems include low output of labour and stiff competition with the synthetic fibre industry . Jute textiles ( edit ) India is the largest producer of raw jute and jute goods and the second largest exporter after Bangladesh . There were about 80 jute mills in India in 2010 - 11 , most of which are located in West Bengal , mainly along the banks of the Hooghly River , in a narrow belt ( 98 km long and 3 km wide ) . Factors responsible for their location in the Hooghly basin are : inexpensive water transport , good network of railways , roadways and waterways to facilitate movement of raw material to mills , abundant water supply , cheap labour from neighbouring states . In 2010 - 2011 the jute industry was supporting 0.37 million workers directly and another 400,000 small and marginal farmers who were engaged in the cultivation of jute . Challenges faced by the industry include stiff competition in the international market from synthetic substitutes and from other countries such as Bangladesh , Brazil , Philippines , Egypt and Thailand . However , the internal demand has been on the rise due to Government policy of mandatory use of jute packaging . To stimulate demand , the products need to be diversified . In 2005 , the National Jute Policy was formulated with the objective of improving quality , increasing productivity and enhancing the yield of the crop . The main markets for jute are the United States , Canada , Russia , United Kingdom and Australia . Ministry of textiles and organizations ( edit ) Government of India passed the National Textile Policy in 2000 . The major functions of the ministry of textiles are formulating policy and coordination of man - made fiber , cotton , jute , silk , wool industries , decentralization of power loom sector , promotion of exports , planning & economic analysis , finance and promoting use of information technology . The advisory boards for the ministry include All India Handlooms Board , All India Handicrafts Board , All India Power looms Board , Advisory Committee under Handlooms Reservation of Articles for Production and Co-ordination Council of Textiles Research Association . There are several public sector units and textile research associations across the country .

The text does not provide a precise figure for Cotton Sector employment but given the Man Made Fibres sector is the largest employer in the textile industries with 4.8 million, Cotton's employment is likely less than 4.8 million.\n\nTherefore, the earlier inference that Cotton employs more than 4.8 million is not supported by the context. The correct understanding is that Man Made Fibres employ the most people (about 4.8 million), and Cotton Sector employs a large but smaller or comparable number, though exact figures are not detailed.",

    "document": "Hydrate - wikipedia Hydrate Jump to : navigation , search This article is about chemical compounds . For hydration in humans or animals , see drinking . In chemistry , a hydrate is a substance that contains water or its constituent elements . The chemical state of the water varies widely between different classes of hydrates , some of which were so labeled before their chemical structure was understood . Contents ( hide ) 1 Chemical nature 1.1 Organic chemistry 1.2 Inorganic chemistry 1.3 Clathrate hydrates 2 Stability 3 See also 4 References Chemical nature ( edit ) Organic chemistry ( edit ) In organic chemistry , a hydrate is a compound formed by the addition of water or its elements to another molecule . For example : ethanol , CH -- CH -- OH , is the product of the hydration reaction of ethene , CH = CH , formed by the addition of H to one C and OH to the other C , and so can be considered as the hydrate of ethene . A molecule of water may be eliminated , for example by the action of sulfuric acid . Another example is chloral hydrate , CCl -- CH ( OH ) , which can be formed by reaction of water with chloral , CCl -- CH =O . Many organic molecules , as well as inorganic molecules , form crystals that incorporate water into the crystalline structure without chemical alteration of the organic molecule ( water of crystallization ) . The sugar trehalose , for example , exists in both an anhydrous form ( melting point 203 ° C ) and as a dihydrate ( melting point 97 ° C ) . Protein crystals commonly have as much as 50 % water content . Molecules are also labeled as hydrates for historical reasons not covered above . Glucose , C H O , was originally thought of as C ( H O ) and described as a carbohydrate . Methanol is often sold as `` methyl hydrate '' , implying the incorrect formula CH OH , while the correct formula is CH -- OH . Inorganic chemistry ( edit ) Main article : water of crystallization Hydrates are inorganic salts `` containing water molecules combined in a definite ratio as an integral part of the crystal '' that are either bound to a metal center or that have crystallized with the metal complex . Such hydrates are also said to contain water of crystallization or water of hydration . If the water is heavy water , where the hydrogen involved is the isotope deuterium , then the term deuterate may be used in place of hydrate . Anhydrous cobalt ( II ) chloride CoCl Cobalt ( II ) chloride hexahydrate CoCl 6H O A colorful example is cobalt ( II ) chloride , which turns from blue to red upon hydration , and can therefore be used as a water indicator . The notation `` hydrated compound ⋅ nH O '' , where n is the number of water molecules per formula unit of the salt , is commonly used to show that a salt is hydrated . The n is usually a low integer , though it is possible for fractional values to occur . For example , in a monohydrate n is one , and in a hexahydrate n is 6 . Numerical prefixes of Greek origin are : Hemi -- 1 / 2 Mono -- 1 Sesqui - 11⁄2 Di -- 2 Tri -- 3 Tetra -- 4 Penta -- 5 Hexa -- 6 Hepta -- 7 Octa -- 8 Nona -- 9 Deca -- 10 Undeca - 11 Dodeca - 12 A hydrate which has lost water is referred to as an anhydride ; the remaining water , if any exists , can only be removed with very strong heating . A substance that does not contain any water is referred to as anhydrous . Some anhydrous compounds are hydrated so easily that they are said to be hygroscopic and are used as drying agents or desiccants . Clathrate hydrates ( edit ) Main article : Clathrate hydrate Clathrate hydrates ( also known as gas hydrates , gas clathrates , etc . ) are water ice with gas molecules trapped within ; they are a form of clathrate . An important example is methane hydrate ( also known as gas hydrate , methane clathrate , etc . ) . Nonpolar molecules such as methane can form clathrate hydrates with water , especially under high pressure . Although there is no hydrogen bonding between water and guest molecules when methane is the guest molecule of the clathrate , guest - host hydrogen bonding often forms when the guest is a larger organic molecule such as tetrahydrofuran . In such cases the guest - host hydrogen bonds result in the formation of L - type Bjerrum defects in the clathrate lattice . Stability ( edit ) The stability of hydrates is generally determined by the nature of the compounds , their temperature , and the relative humidity ( if they are exposed to air ) .

Including the river 's West Branch and South Branch increases the Penobscot 's length to 264 miles ( 425 km ) , making it the second longest river system in Maine and the longest entirely in the state . Its drainage basin contains 8,610 square miles ( 22,300 km ) . It arises from four branches in several lakes in north - central Maine , which flow generally east . After the uniting of the West Branch with the East Branch at Medway ( 45 ° 36 ′ 14 '' N 68 ° 31 ′ 52 '' W ﻿ / ﻿ 45.604 ° N 68.531 ° W ﻿ / 45.604 ; - 68.531 ﻿ ( Penobscot River source ) ) , the Penobscot flows 109 miles ( 175 km ) south , past the city of Bangor , where it becomes navigable . Also at Bangor is the tributary Kenduskeag Stream . It empties into the Atlantic Ocean in Penobscot Bay . It is home to the Penobscot people that live on Indian Island . The United States government maintains three river flow gages on the Penobscot river . The first is on the East Branch in Grindstone ( an unincorporated settlement approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Stacyville ) ( 45 ° 43 ′ 49 '' N 68 ° 35 ′ 22 '' W ﻿ / ﻿ 45.73028 ° N 68.58944 ° W ﻿ / 45.73028 ; - 68.58944 ﻿ ( Grindstone ) ) where the rivershed is 1,086 square miles ( 2,810 km ) .

Contents ( hide ) 1 History 1.1 Norumbega 1.2 Navigation 1.3 French colony 1.4 British colony 1.5 American Revolution and modern history 2 Angling the Penobscot River 3 Popular culture 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History ( edit ) Bucksport Harbor , about 1905 View near Winterport about 1906 Norumbega ( edit ) Most historians have accepted the Penobscot region as Jean Allefonsce 's source for Norumbega , though the matter was hotly contested by some nineteenth century antiquarians , who argued that the name should be identified with their own river or region . Navigation ( edit ) The Penobscot River was an early trade corridor to interior Maine from the Atlantic coast . Ocean ships could navigate upstream to Bangor . The cities of Rockland , Belfast , Brewer and Bangor , and the towns of Rockport , Camden , Northport , Searsport , Stockton Springs , Castine , Bucksport , Frankfort , Winterport , Orrington , and Hampden developed adjacent to the Penobscot River estuary . The river upstream of Bangor became an important transportation corridor for log driving to bring wooden logs and pulpwood from interior forests to sawmills and paper mills built to use water power where the city of Howland and the towns of Veazie , Orono , Old Town , Milford , Passadumkeag , West Enfield , Lincoln , Winn , Mattawamkeag , Medway , and Millinocket developed . French colony ( edit ) The first European known to have explored the river was the Portuguese Estêvão Gomes in 1524 , followed by the Frenchman Samuel de Champlain in 1605 . A few years later French Jesuit priests came among the Penobscot people as missionaries and converted them to Catholicism . The French settlement of Pentagouet , now Castine , was founded at the point where the river becomes Penobscot Bay , and the Penobscot people made a permanent settlement at Indian Old Town , Maine on an island above the head of navigation , around the Catholic mission . Throughout the first half of the 17th centuries , these were likely the only permanent settlements on the river , although the Penobscots considered the entire river and bay their hunting ground and maintained other seasonal villages along its banks . In 1669 , the Mohawk tribe made raids from the west that were very destructive to the Penobscot people . During Father Rale 's War , the English settlers in Massachusetts also sent periodic raiding parties to the Penobscot , destroying the primary native village in 1723 . In a treaty of 1752 , however , Massachusetts laid claim to the entire Penobscot watershed , and in 1759 the Pownall Expedition , led by Governor Thomas Pownall , established Fort Pownall on Cape Jellison in what is now Stockton Springs . This signaled the beginning of English domination , and the incorporation of the Penobscot River valley into New England . The Penobscot at Bangor , Maine Penobscot Narrows and Fort Knox in 2007 British colony ( edit ) The first permanent English settler on the river was Joshua Treat ( 1726 -- 1802 ) , who was initially the armorer and translator at Fort Pownall . His oldest son , Joshua Treat , Jr. , built a log house and sawmill at Marsh Bay in what is now Frankfort , and other members of their extended family , joined by additional settlers from Massachusetts and New Hampshire , pushed ever further up - river , eventually restricting the Penobscot people to Indian Island Old Town , Maine , the present Penobscot Indian Reservation . American revolution and modern history ( edit ) During the American Revolutionary War , the river and bay were the site of the disastrous 1779 Penobscot Expedition , where an entire American fleet was destroyed in a botched attempt to retake Maine from the British . During the War of 1812 , the British again invaded Maine and defeated an American force at the Battle of Hampden , sacking the town of Bangor in the process . To prevent this from happening a third time , and because the nearby boundary between the United States and British Canada was still contested into the 1840s , the Federal government in 1844 began constructing a huge granite fort , Fort Knox , opposite the town of Bucksport , near the mouth of the river . The fort never fired a shot in anger , but remains one of the Penobscot 's major man - made landmarks . In the 19th century the river was a conduit for the transport of logs from Maine 's Great North Woods , to be sawn into lumber at mills around Old Town and Orono , and transported on ships from Bangor , at the head of tide . ( The average high tide at Bangor is 13 feet ( 4 m ) as of 2009 . ) A secondary economic use made of the river late in the century was as a source of sawn ice for urban markets . In the 20th century , lumbering was largely supplanted by papermaking , in the form of large wood pulp and paper mills located all along the river from Millinocket and East Millinocket in the north , to South Brewer and Bucksport in the south . Wood pulp and paper mills create dioxins as a byproduct of the chlorine bleaching process in making paper . This substance was discharged from seven mills located close to the Tribal community of Penobscot people , along the Penobscot river . Dioxins , which are highly potent toxic chemicals that may cause cancer and other health problems , were being poured daily into this adjacent river , the Penobscot . A Penobscot woman , Rebecca Sockbeson , a Penobscot , is quoted saying that her people have survived on fish from this river , but `` now we are dying from it . '' She continued on to say that `` neither dioxin nor cancer is indigenous to the Penobscot people , however they are both pervasive in my tribal community . '' The health and survival of the Penobscot people is further threatened by the impact that persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) have on reproduction and the health of their children . Sockbeson concludes that a treaty is required to ensure that `` the breast and spoon we feed our babies with is not filled with cancer , diabetes , learning disabilities , and attention deficit ( disorder ) . '' The development of cheap hydropower also attracted other types of light manufacturing , like textiles and shoes . In the 21st century , with the continuing decline of the Maine paper industry , and the divestiture of its woodlands , the Penobscot watershed is becoming more and more associated with recreational use ( fishing , hunting , boating , and tourism ) and less with manufacturing . Demolition began on the Great Works Dam in 2012 , and the Veazie Dam in 2013 . A fish ladder has also been installed at Milford Dam . This has led to an increase in the number of Atlantic Salmon , Shad , and other fish species in the river . The river viewed from the Penobscot Narrows Bridge Observatory as it empties in Penobscot Bay ( 2013 ) In 1931 the Waldo - Hancock Bridge was opened to carry US Route 1 across the river at the Penobscot Narrows between Prospect , in Waldo County , and Verona Island just below Bucksport . That bridge was closed and replaced in 2006 by the Penobscot Narrows Bridge , a 2,120 foot long , $85,000,000 structure with 135 feet between the water and the bridge 's deck , and the original bridge was subsequently demolished in 2013 . The new bridge also features an observatory open to the public located 420 feet above the surface of the river in the support tower on the Waldo County side . It is the only bridge observatory in the United States , and only one of four bridge observatories in the world . The two 447 foot tall granite towers of the bridge are patterned after the Washington Monument which had been largely built with granite quarried from nearby Mt . Waldo . Angling the Penobscot river ( edit ) Angling , especially fly fishing , has always been popular on the river . The West Branch is known as a world class landlocked salmon river , while the East Branch is known for its smallmouth bass fishery . In 2008 , the Atlantic Salmon Commission opened the main stem of the river to catch and release fly fishing for Atlantic salmon . The West Branch is home to many types of fish such as landlocked salmon and Brook Trout . There are many deep pools within the river , due to the many slate ledges , making the river ideal for fishing from shore , though there are still areas that are good for canoe fishing . The river is great for a day fishing trip , however there are a few campsites located sporadically around for people who wish to stay more than one day . With the Ripogenus Dam by Chesuncook Lake , the West Branch is able to sustain the large landlocked salmon found there , with twelve miles of heavy rapids , deep runs , large pools , and slower moving water in some sections . Baxter State Park to the north adds to the natural beauty of the area , and natural protection as well . Some of the river 's rapids are class IV or even V , making this one of the roughest rivers in the area , which attracts many whitewater rafters . Until 1971 the West Branch was the main thoroughfare for the Great Northern Paper Company to sluice its logs to its mill in Millinocket , Maine . In 1971 Great Northern opened the Golden Road ( Maine ) for transporting the logs . The road parallels the river . The paper industry has been greatly diminished and the Millinocket mill is in the process of being torn down . The road now is extensively used by sportsmen on the river . As for which flies hatch when ( in order to use the right flies ) , May to June are usually when mayflies begin their first hatch . Caddisflies also start their massive hatch around this time , but it can extend into the fall at times . Stoneflies tend to hatch throughout the season , and often lead to very big catches . In the West Branch , fishermen are often required to use a variety of different techniques in order to catch the elusive fish . Popular culture ( edit ) Henry David Thoreau published an account of travelling up the Penobscot from Bangor in 1846 , to climb Mount Katahdin in his work , Ktaadn . Author Stephen King placed his fictional town of Derry , Maine on the Penobscot . The Penobscot is also featured in the film adaptation of the Tom Clancy novel The Hunt for Red October as the location chosen in which to hide the Soviet Typhoon class submarine from spy satellites . A portion of the Annie Proulx novel Barkskins takes place in Penobscot bay .

Including the river 's West Branch and South Branch increases the Penobscot 's length to 264 miles ( 425 km ) , making it the second longest river system in Maine and the longest entirely in the state . Its drainage basin contains 8,610 square miles ( 22,300 km ) . It arises from four branches in several lakes in north - central Maine , which flow generally east . After the uniting of the West Branch with the East Branch at Medway ( 45 ° 36 ′ 14 '' N 68 ° 31 ′ 52 '' W ﻿ / ﻿ 45.604 ° N 68.531 ° W ﻿ / 45.604 ; - 68.531 ﻿ ( Penobscot River source ) ) , the Penobscot flows 109 miles ( 175 km ) south , past the city of Bangor , where it becomes navigable . Also at Bangor is the tributary Kenduskeag Stream . It empties into the Atlantic Ocean in Penobscot Bay . It is home to the Penobscot people that live on Indian Island . The United States government maintains three river flow gages on the Penobscot river . The first is on the East Branch in Grindstone ( an unincorporated settlement approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Stacyville ) ( 45 ° 43 ′ 49 '' N 68 ° 35 ′ 22 '' W ﻿ / ﻿ 45.73028 ° N 68.58944 ° W ﻿ / 45.73028 ; - 68.58944 ﻿ ( Grindstone ) ) where the rivershed is 1,086 square miles ( 2,810 km ) .

Navigation The Penobscot River was an early trade corridor to interior Maine from the Atlantic coast . Ocean ships could navigate upstream to Bangor . The cities of Rockland , Belfast , Brewer and Bangor , and the towns of Rockport , Camden , Northport , Searsport , Stockton Springs , Castine , Bucksport , Frankfort , Winterport , Orrington , and Hampden developed adjacent to the Penobscot River estuary . The river upstream of Bangor became an important transportation corridor for log driving to bring wooden logs and pulpwood from interior forests to sawmills and paper mills built to use water power where the city of Howland and the towns of Veazie , Orono , Old Town , Milford , Passadumkeag , West Enfield , Lincoln , Winn , Mattawamkeag , Medway , and Millinocket developed .

An individual experiencing sadness may become quiet or lethargic , and withdraw themselves from others . An example of severe sadness is depression , a mood which can be brought on by major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder . Crying can be an indication of sadness . Sadness is one of the `` six basic emotions '' described by Paul Ekman , along with happiness , anger , surprise , fear , and disgust . Contents 1 Childhood 2 Neuroanatomy 3 Coping mechanisms 4 Pupil empathy 5 Vocal patterns 6 Cultural explorations 7 See also 8 References 9 Further reading Childhood Sad girls . Photo by Paolo Monti , 1953 Sadness is a common experience in childhood . Some families may have a ( conscious or unconscious ) rule that sadness is `` not allowed '' , but Robin Skynner has suggested that this may cause problems , arguing that with sadness `` screened off '' , people can become shallow and manic . Pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton suggests that acknowledging sadness can make it easier for families to address more serious emotional problems . Sadness is part of the normal process of the child separating from an early symbiosis with the mother and becoming more independent . Every time a child separates a little more , he or she will have to cope with a small loss . If the mother can not allow the minor distress involved , the child may never learn how to deal with sadness by themselves . Brazelton argues that too much cheering a child up devalues the emotion of sadness for them ; and Selma Fraiberg suggests that it is important to respect a child 's right to experience a loss fully and deeply . Margaret Mahler also saw the ability to feel sadness as an emotional achievement , as opposed for example to warding it off through restless hyperactivity . D.W. Winnicott similarly saw in sad crying the psychological root of valuable musical experiences in later life . Neuroanatomy According to the American Journal of Psychiatry , sadness has been found to be associated with `` increases in bilateral activity within the vicinity of the middle and posterior temporal cortex , lateral cerebellum , cerebellar vermis , midbrain , putamen , and caudate . '' Jose V. Pardo has his M.D and Ph. D and leads a research program in cognitive neuroscience . Using positron emission tomography ( PET ) Pardo and his colleagues were able to provoke sadness among seven normal men and women by asking them to think about sad things . They observed increased brain activity in the bilateral inferior and orbitofrontal cortex . In a study that induced sadness in subjects by showing emotional film clips , the feeling was correlated with significant increases in regional brain activity , especially in the prefrontal cortex , in the region called Brodmann 's area 9 , and the thalamus . A significant increase in activity was also observed in the bilateral anterior temporal structures . Coping mechanisms Main article : Coping ( psychology ) A man expressing sadness with his head in his hands People deal with sadness in different ways , and it is an important emotion because it helps to motivate people to deal with their situation . Some coping mechanisms include : getting social support and / or spending time with a pet , creating a list , or engaging in some activity to express sadness . Some individuals , when feeling sad , may exclude themselves from a social setting , so as to take the time to recover from the feeling . While being one of the moods people most want to shake , sadness can sometimes be perpetuated by the very coping strategies chosen , such as ruminating , `` drowning one 's sorrows '' , or permanently isolating oneself . As alternative ways of coping with sadness to the above , cognitive behavioral therapy suggests instead either challenging one 's negative thoughts , or scheduling some positive event as a distraction . Being attentive to , and patient with , one 's sadness may also be a way for people to learn through solitude ; while emotional support to help people stay with their sadness can be further helpful . Such an approach is fueled by the underlying belief that loss ( when felt wholeheartedly ) can lead to a new sense of aliveness , and to a re-engagement with the outside world . Pupil empathy Pupil size may be an indicator of sadness . A sad facial expression with small pupils is judged to be more intensely sad as the pupil size decreases . A person 's own pupil size also mirrors this and becomes smaller when viewing sad faces with small pupils . No parallel effect exists when people look at neutral , happy or angry expressions . The greater degree to which a person 's pupils mirror another predicts a person 's greater score on empathy . However , in disorders such as autism and psychopathy facial expressions that represent sadness may be subtle , which may show a need for a more non-linguistic situation to affect their level of empathy . Vocal Patterns According to Swati Johar , sadness is an emotion `` identified by current speech dialogue and processing systems '' . Root mean square ( RMS ) energy , inter-word silence and speaking rate were noted as useful measurements in distinguishing sadness from other emotions . It 's communicated mostly by lowering the mean and variability of the fundamental frequency ( f ) , besides being associated with lower vocal intensity , and with decreases in f over time . Johar argues that , `` when someone is sad , slow , low pitched speech with weak high audio frequency energy is produced '' . Likewise , `` low energy state of sadness attributes to slow tempo , lower speech rate and mean pitch '' . Sadness is , as stated by Klaus Scherer , one of the `` best - recognized emotions in the ( human ) voice '' , although it 's `` generally somewhat lower than that of facial expression '' . In a study by Scherer , it was found that in Western countries sadness had 79 % of accuracy for facial recognition and 71 % for vocal , while in Non-Western countries the results were of 74 % and 58 % , respectively . Cultural explorations Lost in thoughts , by Wilhelm Amberg . An individual experiencing sadness may become quiet or lethargic , and withdraw themselves from others . During the Renaissance , Edmund Spenser in The Faerie Queene endorsed sadness as a marker of spiritual commitment . In The Lord of the Rings , sadness is distinguished from unhappiness , to exemplify J.R.R. Tolkien 's preference for a sad , but settled determination , as opposed to what he saw as the shallower temptations of either despair or hope . Julia Kristeva considered that `` a diversification of moods , variety in sadness , refinement in sorrow or mourning are the imprint of a humanity that is surely not triumphant but subtle , ready to fight and creative '' .

Some individuals , when feeling sad , may exclude themselves from a social setting , so as to take the time to recover from the feeling . While being one of the moods people most want to shake , sadness can sometimes be perpetuated by the very coping strategies chosen , such as ruminating , `` drowning one 's sorrows '' , or permanently isolating oneself . As alternative ways of coping with sadness to the above , cognitive behavioral therapy suggests instead either challenging one 's negative thoughts , or scheduling some positive event as a distraction .

Such an approach is fueled by the underlying belief that loss ( when felt wholeheartedly ) can lead to a new sense of aliveness , and to a re-engagement with the outside world .

Johar argues that , `` when someone is sad , slow , low pitched speech with weak high audio frequency energy is produced '' . Likewise , `` low energy state of sadness attributes to slow tempo , lower speech rate and mean pitch '' . Sadness is , as stated by Klaus Scherer , one of the `` best - recognized emotions in the ( human ) voice '' , although it 's `` generally somewhat lower than that of facial expression '' .

'' UK Import CD 2 UK Import CD 2 single cover of `` Chop Suey ! '' Promo CD Promo cover Music video `` Chop Suey ! '' on YouTube `` Chop Suey ! '' is the first single from Armenian - American alternative metal band System of a Down 's second album Toxicity . The single was released in August 2001 and earned the band its first Grammy nomination in 2002 for Best Metal Performance . Loudwire included the song in its list of The Best Hard Rock Songs Of The 21st Century , where it was ranked at number - one . `` Chop Suey ! '' is often seen as the band 's signature song . Contents ( hide ) 1 Overview 2 Song title 3 Music video 4 Controversy 5 Covers and parodies 6 Track listing 7 Chart positions 8 References 9 External links Overview ( edit ) In an interview , Daron Malakian explained , `` The song is about how we are regarded differently depending on how we pass . Everyone deserves to die . Like , if I were now to die from drug abuse , they might say I deserved it because I abused dangerous drugs . Hence the line , ' I cry when angels deserve to die ' . The lyric passages ' Father , into your hands I commend my spirit ' and ' why have you forsaken me ? ' are a reference to Jesus ' death on the cross , as , according to the Gospels , it was one of the seven things Jesus said while dying . '' Song title ( edit ) The song was originally titled `` Suicide '' but the band decided to change it because they wanted to make it radio - friendly . The song title is therefore a wordplay from Self - righteous suicide to `` Self - right - Chop Suey - cide '' that replaces provocation by absurdity . The band members claim this change was not caused by pressure from their record company . Noteworthy , certain pressings of the album include an intro to the track where the comment We 're rolling ' Suicide ' can still be heard faintly before the guitar starts . Music video ( edit ) The music video was the band 's first collaboration with the acclaimed director Marcos Siega , and is set in the car park of the Oak Tree Inn motel in Los Angeles , hometown of the band . The members are performing the song on stage , surrounded by approximately 1,000 fans . Editing devices are used to create the effect of the band members `` walking through '' one another and teleporting on and off the stage , an effect similar to one used in the Red Hot Chili Peppers video `` Around the World '' . One scene briefly shows Tankian eating chop suey with some fans , the only reference to the title dish in either the song or the video . The video makes use of the SnorriCam technique , in which an actor will have a camera attached to them with a harness , making it appear as though the background is moving and the actor is stationary . In the middle of the video the Armenian flag can be seen . The video has more than 650 million views on YouTube as of December 2017 . Controversy ( edit ) `` Chop Suey ! '' is the first single of Toxicity , an album that was number one on the charts during the week of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . A controversy surrounding the popular single , especially the line ' I do n't think you trust in my self - righteous suicide ' , at the time led to Clear Channel Radio placing the song on a list of post-9 / 11 inappropriate titles . Although it was never actually banned completely from the air , Clear Channel Radio stations were advised against playing any of the songs on the list . Covers and parodies ( edit ) The song has been parodied and covered several times . Tenacious D covered the song in live performances , with Jack Black singing gibberish lyrics . `` Weird Al '' Yankovic included the song in the `` Angry White Boy Polka '' medley on his album Poodle Hat . Richard Cheese parodied the song in his 2002 album Tuxicity ( which itself is a take - off on the album 's name ) . ApologetiX parodied the song as `` Downer of a Sister '' on their album Adam Up . Filipino band Parokya ni Edgar also parodied this song , along with `` Toxicity '' , another of System of a Down 's songs , and amalgamated it as `` The Ordertaker '' in their album Halina sa Parokya , about an angry customer at a restaurant that has a menu but sells nothing . Casey Shea recorded a cover for Engine Room Recordings ' compilation album Guilt by Association Vol. 1 , which was released in September 2007 . In 2017 , Anthony Vincent , the vocalist behind YouTube series Ten Seconds Songs , re-interpreted `` Chop Suey ! '' in 20 different styles . Peruvian singer Tongo recorded a parody of the song at the end of 2016 , titled Selfo Radio Suisay , based on the pronunciation of Spanish phonetic sounds of the line `` self - righteous suicide '' .

'' is the first single from Armenian - American alternative metal band System of a Down 's second album Toxicity . The single was released in August 2001 and earned the band its first Grammy nomination in 2002 for Best Metal Performance . Loudwire included the song in its list of The Best Hard Rock Songs Of The 21st Century , where it was ranked at number - one . `` Chop Suey ! '' is often seen as the band 's signature song . Contents ( hide ) 1 Overview 2 Song title 3 Music video 4 Controversy 5 Covers and parodies 6 Track listing 7 Chart positions 8 References 9 External links Overview In an interview , Daron Malakian explained , `` The song is about how we are regarded differently depending on how we pass . Everyone deserves to die . Like , if I were now to die from drug abuse , they might say I deserved it because I abused dangerous drugs . Hence the line , ' I cry when angels deserve to die ' . The lyric passages ' Father , into your hands I commend my spirit ' and ' why have you forsaken me ? ' are a reference to Jesus ' death on the cross , as , according to the Gospels , it was one of the seven things Jesus said while dying . '' Song title The song was originally titled `` Suicide '' but the band decided to change it because they wanted to make it radio - friendly . The song title is therefore a wordplay from Self - righteous suicide to `` Self - right - Chop Suey - cide '' that replaces provocation by absurdity . The band members claim this change was not caused by pressure from their record company . Noteworthy , certain pressings of the album include an intro to the track where the comment We 're rolling ' Suicide ' can still be heard faintly before the guitar starts . Music video The music video was the band 's first collaboration with the acclaimed director Marcos Siega , and is set in the car park of the Oak Tree Inn motel in Los Angeles , hometown of the band . The members are performing the song on stage , surrounded by approximately 1,000 fans . Editing devices are used to create the effect of the band members `` walking through '' one another and teleporting on and off the stage , an effect similar to one used in the Red Hot Chili Peppers video `` Around the World '' . One scene briefly shows Tankian eating chop suey with some fans , the only reference to the title dish in either the song or the video . The video makes use of the SnorriCam technique , in which an actor will have a camera attached to them with a harness , making it appear as though the background is moving and the actor is stationary . In the middle of the video the Armenian flag can be seen . The video has more than 650 million views on YouTube as of December 2017 . Controversy `` Chop Suey !

    "document": "National Grange of the order of Patrons of Husbandry - wikipedia National Grange of the order of Patrons of Husbandry `` Grange Hall '' redirects here . For other Grange Halls including individual Grange Hall buildings , see The Grange ( disambiguation ) . Grange Hall in Solon , Maine , circa 1910 The Grange , officially referred to as The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry , is a fraternal organization in the United States that encourages families to band together to promote the economic and political well - being of the community and agriculture . The Grange , founded after the Civil War in 1867 , is the oldest American agricultural advocacy group with a national scope . The Grange actively lobbied state legislatures and Congress for political goals , such as the Granger Laws to lower rates charged by railroads , and rural free mail delivery by the Post Office . In 2005 , the Grange had a membership of 160,000 , with organizations in 2,100 communities in 36 states . It is headquartered in Washington , D.C. , in a building built by the organization in 1960 . Many rural communities in the United States still have a Grange Hall and local Granges still serve as a center of rural life for many farming communities . Contents ( hide ) 1 History 2 Today 3 Rituals and ceremonies 4 Organization 5 See also 6 References 7 Further reading 7.1 Primary sources 8 External links History ( edit ) Promotional poster , ca . 1873 , that offers a `` gift for the grangers '' President Andrew Johnson commissioned Oliver Kelley to go to the Southern states and to collect data to improve Southern agricultural conditions . In the South , poor farmers bore the brunt of the Civil War and were suspicious of Northerners like Kelley . Kelley found he was able to overcome these sectional differences as a Mason . With Southern Masons as guides , he toured the war - torn countryside in the South and was appalled by the outdated farming practices . He saw the need for an organization that would bring people from the North and South together in a spirit of mutual cooperation and , after many letters and consultations with the other founders , the Grange was born . The first Grange , Grange # 1 , was founded in 1868 in Fredonia , New York . Seven men and one woman co-founded the Grange : Oliver Hudson Kelley , William Saunders , Francis M. McDowell , John Trimble , Aaron B. Grosh , John R. Thompson , William M. Ireland , and Caroline Hall . Paid agents organized local Granges and membership in the Grange increased dramatically from 1873 ( 200,000 ) to 1875 ( 858,050 ) . Many of the state and local granges adopted non-partisan political resolutions , especially regarding the regulation of railroad transportation costs . The organization was unusual at this time because women and any teen old enough to draw a plow were encouraged to participate . The importance of women was reinforced by requiring that four of the elected positions could be held only by women . 1967 U.S. postage stamp honoring the National Grange Rapid growth infused the national organization with money from dues , and many local granges established consumer cooperatives , initially supplied by the wholesaler Aaron Montgomery Ward . Poor fiscal management , combined with organizational difficulties resulting from rapid growth , led to a massive decline in membership . By the turn of the 20th century , the Grange rebounded and membership stabilized . The Granger movement supported efforts by politicians to regulate rates charged by the railroads and grain warehouses . It claimed credit for the ideas of the Cooperative Extension Service , Rural Free Delivery , and the Farm Credit System . The peak of their political reputation was marked by the Supreme Court decision in Munn v. Illinois ( 1877 ) , which held that grain warehouses were a `` private utility in the public interest , '' and so could be regulated by public law . However this achievement was overturned later by the Supreme Court in Wabash v. Illinois ( 1886 ) . The Grange also endorsed the temperance cause to avoid alcohol , the direct election of Senators and women 's suffrage . Grange membership has declined considerably as the percentage of American farmers has fallen from a third of the population in the early 20th century to less than two percent today . Between 1992 and 2007 , the number of Grange members fell by 40 % . Washington has the largest membership of any state , at approximately 13,000 . Today ( edit ) Union Grange Hall in Slatersville , Rhode Island , now a community center As of 2013 the Grange continues to press for the causes of farmers , including issues of free trade and farm policy . In its 2006 Journal of Proceedings , the organization 's report on its annual convention , the organization lays out its mission and how it works towards achieving it through fellowship , service , and legislation : The Grange provides opportunities for individuals and families to develop to their highest potential in order to build stronger communities and states , as well as a stronger nation . As a non-partisan organization , the Grange supports only policies , never political parties or candidates . Although the Grange was founded to serve the interests of farmers , because of the shrinking farm population the Grange has begun to broaden its range to include a wide variety of issues , and anyone is welcome to join the Grange . The Junior Grange is open to children 5 - 14 . Regular Grange membership is open to anyone age 14 or older . The Grange Youth , a group within the Grange , consists of members 13 1 / 2 - 35 . In 2013 , the Grange signed on to a letter to Congress calling for the doubling of legal immigration and legalization for undocumented immigrants currently in the United States . However , this position has been somewhat revised , and the Grange now emphasizes an expansion in the H - 2A visa program to increase legal immigration and address the crisis - level labor shortage in agriculture . They support the enforcement of immigration law but urge discretion with regard to the impact on labor availability . Rituals and ceremonies ( edit ) Grange in session , 1873 When the Grange first began in 1867 , it borrowed some of its rituals and symbols from Freemasonry , including secret meetings , oaths and special passwords . It also copied ideas from Greek and Roman mythology and the Bible . Small , ceremonial farm tools are often displayed at Grange meetings . Elected officers are in charge of opening and closing each meeting . There are seven degrees of Grange membership ; the ceremony of each degree relates to the seasons and various symbols and principles . During the last few decades , the Grange has moved toward public meetings and no longer meets in secret . Though the secret meetings do not occur , the Grange still acknowledges its rich history and practices some traditions . Organization ( edit ) This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( March 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The Grange is a hierarchical organization ranging from local communities to the National Grange organization . At the local level are community Granges , otherwise known as subordinate Granges . All members are affiliated with at least one subordinate . In most states , multiple subordinate Granges are grouped together to form Pomona Granges . Typically , Pomona Granges are made up of all the subordinates in a county . Next in the order come State Granges , which is where the Grange begins to be especially active in the political process . State Masters ( Presidents ) are responsible for supervising the administration of Subordinate and Pomona Granges . Together , thirty - five State Granges , as well as Potomac Grange # 1 in Washington , D.C. , form the National Grange . The National Grange represents the interests of most Grangers in lobbying activities similar to the state , but on a much larger scale . In addition , the National Grange oversees the Grange ritual . The Grange is a grassroots organization ; virtually all policy originates at the subordinate level . The motto of the Grange is In necessariis unitas , in dubiis libertas , in omnibus caritas ( `` In essentials , unity ; in non-essentials , liberty ; in all things , charity '' ) . Indeed , the word `` grange '' comes from a Latin word for grain , and is related to a `` granary '' or , generically , a farm .

As a non-partisan organization , the Grange supports only policies , never political parties or candidates .

Illinois ( 1886 ) . The Grange also endorsed the temperance cause to avoid alcohol , the direct election of Senators and women 's suffrage . Grange membership has declined considerably as the percentage of American farmers has fallen from a third of the population in the early 20th century to less than two percent today . Between 1992 and 2007 , the number of Grange members fell by 40 % . Washington has the largest membership of any state , at approximately 13,000 . Today Union Grange Hall in Slatersville , Rhode Island , now a community center As of 2013 the Grange continues to press for the causes of farmers , including issues of free trade and farm policy . In its 2006 Journal of Proceedings , the organization 's report on its annual convention , the organization lays out its mission and how it works towards achieving it through fellowship , service , and legislation : The Grange provides opportunities for individuals and families to develop to their highest potential in order to build stronger communities and states , as well as a stronger nation . As a non-partisan organization , the Grange supports only policies , never political parties or candidates . Although the Grange was founded to serve the interests of farmers , because of the shrinking farm population the Grange has begun to broaden its range to include a wide variety of issues , and anyone is welcome to join the Grange . The Junior Grange is open to children 5 - 14 . Regular Grange membership is open to anyone age 14 or older . The Grange Youth , a group within the Grange , consists of members 13 1 / 2 - 35 . In 2013 , the Grange signed on to a letter to Congress calling for the doubling of legal immigration and legalization for undocumented immigrants currently in the United States . However , this position has been somewhat revised , and the Grange now emphasizes an expansion in the H - 2A visa program to increase legal immigration and address the crisis - level labor shortage in agriculture . They support the enforcement of immigration law but urge discretion with regard to the impact on labor availability . Rituals and ceremonies Grange in session , 1873 When the Grange first began in 1867 , it borrowed some of its rituals and symbols from Freemasonry , including secret meetings , oaths and special passwords . It also copied ideas from Greek and Roman mythology and the Bible . Small , ceremonial farm tools are often displayed at Grange meetings . Elected officers are in charge of opening and closing each meeting . There are seven degrees of Grange membership ; the ceremony of each degree relates to the seasons and various symbols and principles . During the last few decades , the Grange has moved toward public meetings and no longer meets in secret . Though the secret meetings do not occur , the Grange still acknowledges its rich history and practices some traditions . Organization This section does not cite any sources .

( March 2014 ) The Grange is a hierarchical organization ranging from local communities to the National Grange organization . At the local level are community Granges , otherwise known as subordinate Granges . All members are affiliated with at least one subordinate . In most states , multiple subordinate Granges are grouped together to form Pomona Granges . Typically , Pomona Granges are made up of all the subordinates in a county . Next in the order come State Granges , which is where the Grange begins to be especially active in the political process . State Masters ( Presidents ) are responsible for supervising the administration of Subordinate and Pomona Granges .

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( August 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Accord and satisfaction is a contract law concept about the purchase of the release from a debt obligation . It is one of the methods by which parties to a contract may terminate their agreement . The release is completed by the transfer of valuable consideration that must not be the actual performance of the obligation itself . The accord is the agreement to discharge the obligation and the satisfaction is the legal `` consideration '' which binds the parties to the agreement . A valid accord does not discharge the prior contract ; instead it suspends the right to enforce it in accordance with the terms of the accord contract , in which satisfaction , or performance of the contract will discharge both contracts ( the original and the accord ) . If the creditor breaches the accord , then the debtor will be able to bring up the existence of the accord in order to enjoin any action against him . If a person is sued over an alleged debt , that person bears the burden of proving the affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction .

For example , a builder is contracted to build a homeowner a garage for $35,000 . The contract called for $17,500 prior to starting construction , to disburse $10,000 during various stages of construction , and to make a final payment of $7,500 at completion . At completion , the homeowner complained about inferior work quality and refused to make the final payment . After a mutual settlement agreement , the builder accepted $4,000 as full payment . Thereby , a new contract was formed by offer , acceptance , and consideration . The consideration is that for a $3,500 savings , the homeowner gives up that which he is entitled , a well - constructed garage . The builder gives up his right to full price to avoid suit for inferior performance . When accord and settlement has occurred , the homeowner and builder have given up his right to sue for more money under this settlement agreement . Another example would be where a lender agrees to lend $100,000 at 5.0 % interest for 30 years , and at the closing the loan documents are all drawn up for a loan with a 6.0 % interest rate . If the lender agrees to reduce the closing costs by an extra $1000 and the borrowers agree , then there has been an accord and satisfaction . If the borrowers later sue for breach of contract , the settlement ( offer and acceptance of the $1000 ) constitutes an accord and satisfaction and is a valid defense to the borrower 's lawsuit . The accord agreement must be transacted on a new agreement . It must therefore have the essential terms of a contract , ( parties , subject matter , time for performance , and consideration ) . If there is a breach of the accord there will be no `` satisfaction '' which will give rise to a breach of accord . In this instance the non-offending party has the right to sue under either the original contract or the accord agreement . Consideration ( edit ) In an accord contract it is typical that the consideration supplied is less than bargained for in the original contract . In accord contracts that require an amount of consideration that is less than the original , the consideration must be of a different type , i.e. instead of money , debtor offers a car or a boat .

        "rag_answer": "Accord and satisfaction is a legal concept in contract law where the parties agree to settle a dispute or a debt by reaching a new agreement (the accord) which is then executed or performed (the satisfaction). This new agreement serves as a valid defense if one party tries to sue under the original contract.\n\nFor an accord to be valid, it must have all the essential terms of a contract, including:\n\n- The parties involved  \n- The subject matter  \n- The time for performance  \n- Consideration (something of value exchanged)\n\nTypically, the consideration in an accord is different from or less than what was originally agreed upon. For example, instead of paying the original amount of money owed, the debtor might offer a car or boat. \n\nIf the accord is breached (meaning the new agreement is not performed), there is no \"satisfaction,\" and the non-offending party has the right to sue either under the original contract or the new accord agreement.\n\nKey points include:\n\n- Accord is the new agreement to settle the original obligation.\n- Satisfaction is the execution or performance of that accord.\n- If satisfaction is incomplete or breached, the original contract or accord can be enforced.\n- Consideration must be present and typically differs from the original contract.\n\nCases such as Foakes v. Beer and Pinnel's Case illustrate aspects of accord and satisfaction, particularly around consideration and payment of lesser amounts.",

This new agreement and payment constitute an accord and satisfaction. Mary cannot later sue John for the remaining $2,000 because the dispute was settled by this new contract.\n\nHowever, if John fails to pay the $3,000 as agreed (breach of accord), Mary can sue John either under the original contract for $5,000 or the accord agreement for $3,000.\n\nThis example also illustrates that the accord involves a different consideration (less money) due to the original debt being disputed.",

    "document": "Stratovolcano - wikipedia Stratovolcano Jump to : navigation , search Mount Vesuvius near Naples , Italy , erupted in 79 AD . The last eruption of this stratovolcano occurred in March 1944 . A stratovolcano , also known as a composite volcano , is a conical volcano built up by many layers ( strata ) of hardened lava , tephra , pumice , and volcanic ash . Unlike shield volcanoes , stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions , although some have collapsed craters called calderas . The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity . The magma forming this lava is often felsic , having high - to - intermediate levels of silica ( as in rhyolite , dacite , or andesite ) , with lesser amounts of less - viscous mafic magma . Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon , but have travelled as far as 15 km ( 9.3 mi ) . Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called `` composite volcanoes '' because of their composite layered structure built up from sequential outpourings of eruptive materials . They are among the most common types of volcanoes , in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes . Two famous stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa , best known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883 and Vesuvius , famous for its destruction of the towns Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79 CE . Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives . In modern times , Mount Saint Helens and Mount Pinatubo have erupted catastrophically . Existence of stratovolcanoes has not been proved on other terrestrial bodies of the solar system with one exception . Their existence was suggested for some isolated massifs on Mars , e.g. , Zephyria Tholus . Contents ( hide ) 1 Creation 2 Hazards 2.1 Ash 2.2 Lava 2.3 Volcanic bombs 2.4 Mudflows 3 Climatic effects 4 See also 5 References Creation Cross-section of subduction zone and associated stratovolcano See also : Igneous rock Stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones , forming chains along plate tectonic boundaries where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust ( continental arc volcanism , e.g. Cascade Range , central Andes ) or another oceanic plate ( island arc volcanism , e.g. Japan , Aleutian Islands ) . The magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab . The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed `` dewatering '' , and occurs at specific pressures and temperatures for each mineral , as the plate descends to greater depths . The water freed from the rock lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock , which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its lighter density relative to the surrounding mantle rock , and pools temporarily at the base of the lithosphere . The magma then rises through the crust , incorporating silica - rich crustal rock , leading to a final intermediate composition . When the magma nears the top surface , it pools in a magma chamber under or within the volcano . There , the relatively low pressure allows water and other volatiles ( mainly CO , SO , Cl , and H O ) dissolved in the magma to escape from solution , as occurs when a bottle of carbonated water is opened , releasing CO . Once a critical volume of magma and gas accumulates , the obstacle ( rock blockage ) of the volcanic cone is overcome , leading to a sudden explosive eruption . Hazards Mount Etna on the island of Sicily , in Italy . Mount Fuji on Honshu ( top ) and Mount Unzen on Kyushu ( bottom ) , two of Japan 's stratovolcanoes . In recorded history , explosive eruptions at subduction zone ( convergent - boundary ) volcanoes have posed the greatest hazard to civilizations . Subduction - zone stratovolcanoes , such as Mount St. Helens , Mount Etna and Mount Pinatubo , typically erupt with explosive force : the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases . As a consequence , the tremendous internal pressures of the trapped volcanic gases remain in the pasty magma . Following the breaching of the magma chamber , the magma degasses explosively . The gases and water gush out with speed and force . Since 1600 CE , nearly 300,000 people have been killed by volcanic eruptions . Most deaths were caused by pyroclastic flows and mudflows , deadly hazards that often accompany explosive eruptions of subduction - zone stratovolcanoes . Pyroclastic flows are fast - moving , avalanche - like , ground - hugging , incandescent mixtures of hot volcanic debris , ash , lava fragments and superheated gases that can travel at speeds in excess of 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) . Around 30,000 people were killed by pyroclastic flows during the 1902 eruption of Mont Pelée on the island of Martinique in the Caribbean . In March & April 1982 , three explosive eruptions of El Chichón Volcano in the State of Chiapas , southeastern Mexico , caused the worst volcanic disaster in that country 's history . Villages within 8 km ( 5 mi ) of the volcano were destroyed by pyroclastic flows , killing more than 2,000 people . Two Decade Volcanoes that erupted in 1991 provide examples of stratovolcano hazards . On June 15 , Mount Pinatubo spewed an ash cloud 40 km ( 25 mi ) into the air and produced huge pyroclastic flows and lahar flows that devastated a large area around the volcano . Pinatubo , located 90 km ( 56 mi ) from Manila , had been dormant for 600 years before the 1991 eruption , which ranks as one of the largest eruptions in the 20th century . Also in 1991 , Japan 's Unzen Volcano , located on the island of Kyushu about 40 km ( 25 mi ) east of Nagasaki , awakened from its 200 - year slumber to produce a new lava dome at its summit . Beginning in June , repeated collapse of this erupting dome generated ash flows that swept down the mountain 's slopes at speeds as high as 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) . Unzen is one of more than 75 active volcanoes in Japan ; an eruption in 1792 killed more than 15,000 people -- the worst volcanic disaster in the country 's history . The A.D. 79 Plinian eruption of Mount Vesuvius , a stratovolcano looming adjacent to Naples , completely covered the ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum with deposits of pyroclastic surges and lava flows . The death toll ranged between 13,000 and 26,000 , yet the exact death toll remains unknown . Mount Vesuvius is recognized as one of the most dangerous volcanoes , jointly because of its potential for powerful explosive eruptions and the high population density of the area ( totaling about 3 million people ) around its perimeter . Ash Snow - like blanket of Mount Pinatubo 's ashfall deposits of June 15 , 1991 . Main article : Volcanic ash Apart from possibly affecting the climate , volcanic clouds from explosive eruptions also pose a serious hazard to aviation safety . For example , during the 1982 eruption of Galunggung in Java , British Airways Flight 9 flew into the ash cloud , suffering temporary engine failure and structural damage . During the past two decades , more than 60 airplanes , mostly commercial jetliners , have been damaged by in - flight encounters with volcanic ash . Some of these encounters have resulted in the power loss of all engines , necessitating emergency landings . Luckily , to date no crashes have happened because of jet aircraft flying into volcanic ash . Ashfall is a threat to health when inhaled , and is also a threat to property with enough accumulation . An accumulation of 30 cm ( 12 in ) is sufficient to cause most buildings to collapse . Dense clouds of hot volcanic ash , caused by the collapse of an eruptive column or by being laterally expelled from the partial collapse of a volcanic edifice or lava dome during an explosive eruption , can produce devastating pyroclastic flows which can wipe out everything in their paths . Lava Mayon Volcano producing lava flows during its eruption on December 29 , 2009 . Main article : Lava Lava flows from stratovolcanoes are generally not a significant threat to people because the highly viscous lava moves slowly enough for people to move out of the path of flow . The lava flows are more of a threat to property . However , not all stratovolcanoes erupt viscous , blocky lava . Mount Nyiragongo is very dangerous because its magma has an unusually low silica content , making it quite fluid . Fluid lavas are typically associated with the formation of broad shield volcanoes such as those of Hawaii , but Nyiragongo has very steep slopes down which lava can flow at up to 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) . Lava flows could melt down ice and glaciers that accumulated on the volcano 's crater and upper slopes , generating massive lahar flows . Rarely , generally fluid lava could also generate a massive lava fountain , while lava of thicker viscosity can solidify within the vent , creating a block which can result in highly explosive eruptions . Volcanic bombs Main article : Volcanic bomb Volcanic bombs are extrusive igneous rocks ranging from the size of books to small cars , that are explosively ejected from stratovolcanoes during their climactic eruptive phases . These `` bombs '' can travel over 20 km ( 12 mi ) away from the volcano , and present a risk to buildings and living things while traveling at very high speeds ( hundreds of kilometers / miles per hour ) through the air . Most bombs do not themselves explode on impact , but rather carry enough force so as to have destructive effects as if they exploded . Mudflows Main article : Lahar Mudflows ( also called debris flows or lahars , a Javanese term for volcanic mudflows ) are mixtures of volcanic debris and water . The water usually comes from two sources : rainfall or the melting of snow and ice by hot volcanic debris , such as lava . Depending on the proportion and temperature of water to volcanic material , mudflows can range from fast - flowing , soupy floods to thick , gooey flows that have the consistency of wet concrete . As mudflows sweep down the steep sides of stratovolcanoes , they have the strength and speed to flatten or bury everything in their paths . Hot ash , lava flows and pyroclastic surges from the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia melted snow and ice atop the 5,321 meter - high Andean volcano . The ensuing mudflows buried the nearby city of Armero , killing 25,000 people . Climatic effects Paluweh eruption as seen from space As per the above examples , while the Unzen eruptions have caused deaths and considerable local damage in the historic past , the impact of the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo was global . Slightly cooler - than - usual temperatures were recorded worldwide , and brilliant sunsets and intense sunrises were attributed to the particulates , this eruption lofted high into the stratosphere . The aerosol that formed from the sulfur dioxide ( SO ) , carbon dioxide ( CO ) and other gasses dispersed around the world . The SO mass in this cloud -- about 22 million tons -- combined with water ( both of volcanic and stratospheric origin ) formed droplets of sulfuric acid , blocking a portion of the sunlight from reaching the troposphere and ground . The cooling in some regions is thought to have been as much as 0.5 ° C. An eruption the size of Mount Pinatubo tends to affect the weather for a few years ; the material injected into the stratosphere gradually drops into the troposphere , where it is washed away by rain and cloud precipitation . A similar , but extraordinarily more powerful phenomenon occurred in the cataclysmic April 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on Sumbawa Island in Indonesia . The Mount Tambora eruption is recognized as the most powerful eruption in recorded history . Its volcanic cloud lowered global temperatures by as much as 3.5 ° C. In the year following the eruption , most of the Northern Hemisphere experienced sharply cooler temperatures during the summer . In parts of Europe , Asia and North America , 1816 was known as the `` Year Without a Summer '' , which caused a considerable agricultural distress and a brief but bitter famine .

The high silica content increases the magma's viscosity, making it stiffer and causing the lava to cool and harden before spreading far. This high viscosity differentiates stratovolcano magma from the less viscous mafic magma found in other types of volcanoes.",

            "page_content": "Stratovolcano - wikipedia Stratovolcano Jump to : navigation , search Mount Vesuvius near Naples , Italy , erupted in 79 AD . The last eruption of this stratovolcano occurred in March 1944 . A stratovolcano , also known as a composite volcano , is a conical volcano built up by many layers ( strata ) of hardened lava , tephra , pumice , and volcanic ash . Unlike shield volcanoes , stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions , although some have collapsed craters called calderas . The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity . The magma forming this lava is often felsic , having high - to - intermediate levels of silica ( as in rhyolite , dacite , or andesite ) , with lesser amounts of less - viscous mafic magma . Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon , but have travelled as far as 15 km ( 9.3 mi ) . Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called `` composite volcanoes '' because of their composite layered structure built up from sequential outpourings of eruptive materials . They are among the most common types of volcanoes , in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes . Two famous stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa , best known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883 and Vesuvius , famous for its destruction of the towns Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79 CE . Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives . In modern times , Mount Saint Helens and Mount Pinatubo have erupted catastrophically . Existence of stratovolcanoes has not been proved on other terrestrial bodies of the solar system with one exception . Their existence was suggested for some isolated massifs on Mars , e.g. , Zephyria Tholus .

The magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab . The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed `` dewatering '' , and occurs at specific pressures and temperatures for each mineral , as the plate descends to greater depths . The water freed from the rock lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock , which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its lighter density relative to the surrounding mantle rock , and pools temporarily at the base of the lithosphere . The magma then rises through the crust , incorporating silica - rich crustal rock , leading to a final intermediate composition . When the magma nears the top surface , it pools in a magma chamber under or within the volcano . There , the relatively low pressure allows water and other volatiles ( mainly CO , SO , Cl , and H O ) dissolved in the magma to escape from solution , as occurs when a bottle of carbonated water is opened , releasing CO . Once a critical volume of magma and gas accumulates , the obstacle ( rock blockage ) of the volcanic cone is overcome , leading to a sudden explosive eruption . Hazards Mount Etna on the island of Sicily , in Italy . Mount Fuji on Honshu ( top ) and Mount Unzen on Kyushu ( bottom ) , two of Japan 's stratovolcanoes . In recorded history , explosive eruptions at subduction zone ( convergent - boundary ) volcanoes have posed the greatest hazard to civilizations . Subduction - zone stratovolcanoes , such as Mount St. Helens , Mount Etna and Mount Pinatubo , typically erupt with explosive force : the magma is too stiff",

Main article : Lava Lava flows from stratovolcanoes are generally not a significant threat to people because the highly viscous lava moves slowly enough for people to move out of the path of flow .

Sperm motility in mammals also facilitates the passage of the sperm through the cumulus oophorus ( a layer of cells ) and the zona pellucida ( a layer of extracellular matrix ) , which surround the mammalian oocyte .

        "rag_answer": "Factors that can affect sperm motility include:\n\n1. Changes in intracellular ion concentration: Different species have different ion changes that activate motility. For example, in marine invertebrates and sea urchins, a rise in pH to about 7.2–7.6 activates ATPase, leading to decreased intracellular potassium and membrane hyperpolarization, which activates sperm movement.\n\n2. pH levels: In some mammals, an increase in pH activates sperm motility, while low pH in the epididymis suppresses it.\n\n3. Calcium ion concentration: In mammals, an increase in calcium ions can activate sperm motility and initiate hyperactivation.\n\n4. cAMP levels: An increase in cAMP can activate sperm motility in some mammals.\n\n5. Changes in cell volume: Alterations in cell volume can change intracellular ion concentrations, contributing to motility activation.\n\n6. Factors released by eggs: Certain substances released by eggs can affect sperm motility.\n\n7. Maturation processes: Functional maturation of sperm (capacitation) affects motility, with motility reduced when sperm attach to the epithelium of the isthmic oviduct and increased near ovulation during hyperactivation.\n\n8. Sperm DNA damage: Sperm DNA fragmentation is linked to motility defects.\n\nTherefore, physiological conditions, ion concentrations, biochemical signals, and the sperm's functional state all influence sperm motility.",

Sperm motility can also be thought of as the quality , which is a factor in successful conception ; sperm that do not `` swim '' properly will not reach the egg in order to fertilize it . Sperm motility in mammals also facilitates the passage of the sperm through the cumulus oophorus ( a layer of cells ) and the zona pellucida ( a layer of extracellular matrix ) , which surround the mammalian oocyte . In the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus , sperms aggregate in ' trains ' that are better able to fertilize eggs because they are more capable of navigating the viscous environment of the female reproductive tract . The trains move in a sinusoidal motion . Sperm motility is also affected by certain factors released by eggs . Sperm movement is activated by changes in intracellular ion concentration . The changes in ion concentration that provoke motility are different among species . In marine invertebrates and sea urchins , the rise in pH to about 7.2 -- 7.6 activates ATPase which leads to a decrease in intracellular potassium , and thus induces membrane hyperpolarization . As a result , sperm movement is activated . The change in cell volume which alters intracellular ion concentration can also contribute to the activation of sperm motility . In some mammals , sperm motility is activated by increase in pH , calcium ion and cAMP , yet it is suppressed by low pH in the epididymis .

    "document": "Veil of ignorance - wikipedia Veil of ignorance Symbolic depiction of Rawls 's veil of ignorance . The citizens making the choices about their society make them from an `` original position '' of equality and ignorance ( left ) , without knowing what gender , race , abilities , tastes , wealth , or position in society they will have ( right ) . Rawls claims this ensures they will choose a just society . This article is about the philosophical concept . For the music album , see Veil of Ignorance ( album ) . The `` veil of ignorance '' is a method of determining the morality of political issues proposed in 1971 by American philosopher John Rawls in his `` original position '' political philosophy . It is based upon the following thought experiment : people making political decisions imagine that they know nothing about the particular talents , abilities , tastes , social class , and positions they will have within a social order . When such parties are selecting the principles for distribution of rights , positions , and resources in the society in which they will live , this `` veil of ignorance '' prevents them from knowing who will receive a given distribution of rights , positions , and resources in that society . For example , for a proposed society in which 50 % of the population is kept in slavery , it follows that on entering the new society there is a 50 % likelihood that the participant would be a slave . The idea is that parties subject to the veil of ignorance will make choices based upon moral considerations , since they will not be able to make choices based on their own self - or class - interest . As Rawls put it , `` no one knows his place in society , his class position or social status ; nor does he know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities , his intelligence and strength , and the like '' . The idea of the thought experiment is to render obsolete those personal considerations that are morally irrelevant to the justice or injustice of principles meant to allocate the benefits of social cooperation . The veil of ignorance is part of a long tradition of thinking in terms of a social contract that includes the writings of Immanuel Kant , Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , Jean Jacques Rousseau , and Thomas Jefferson . Contents 1 The concept 2 History 3 See also 4 References 5 External links The concept ( edit ) Spencer J. Maxcy outlines the concept as follows : Imagine that you have set for yourself the task of developing a totally new social contract for today 's society . How could you do so fairly ? Although you could never actually eliminate all of your personal biases and prejudices , you would need to take steps at least to minimize them . Rawls suggests that you imagine yourself in an original position behind a veil of ignorance . Behind this veil , you know nothing of yourself and your natural abilities , or your position in society . You know nothing of your sex , race , nationality , or individual tastes . Behind such a veil of ignorance all individuals are simply specified as rational , free , and morally equal beings . You do know that in the `` real world '' , however , there will be a wide variety in the natural distribution of natural assets and abilities , and that there will be differences of sex , race , and culture that will distinguish groups of people from each other . It has been argued that such a concept can have grand effects if it were to be practiced both in the present and in the past . Referring again to the example of slavery , if the slave - owners were forced through the veil of ignorance to imagine that they themselves may be slaves , then suddenly slavery may no longer seem justifiable . Perhaps the entire practice would have been abolished without the need for a war to settle things . A grander example would be if each individual in society were to base their practices off the fact that they could be the least advantaged member of society . In this scenario , freedom and equality could possibly coexist in a way that has been the ideal of many philosophers . For example , in the imaginary society , one might or might not be intelligent , rich , or born into a preferred class . Since one may occupy any position in the society once the veil is lifted , the device forces the parties to consider society from the perspective of all members , including the worst - off and best - off members . History ( edit ) The concept of the veil of ignorance has been in use by other names for centuries by philosophers such as John Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kant whose work discussed the concept of the social contract . John Harsanyi helped to formalize the concept in economics , and argued that it provides an argument in favor of utilitarianism rather than an argument for a social contract . The modern usage was developed by John Rawls in his 1971 book A Theory of Justice . See also ( edit ) Divide and choose Pie rule Tabula rasa References ( edit ) Jump up ^ Rawls , John ( 1999 ) .

        "answer": "John Rawls's veil of ignorance is a thought experiment where individuals making political decisions imagine they know nothing about their own talents, abilities, social class, or position in society. This ensures they choose principles of justice impartially, without favoring their own interests, as they could end up in any social position.",

        "rag_answer": "The veil of ignorance, as proposed by John Rawls in his 1971 book \"A Theory of Justice,\" is a thought experiment designed to ensure fairness and impartiality in the creation of a just society. It requires individuals to make decisions about the principles of justice without any knowledge of their own specific characteristics or social status. Essentially, people imagine themselves behind a \"veil\" that obscures information about their intelligence, wealth, class, or any other particular advantage or disadvantage they might have.\n\nBecause individuals do not know whether they will be among the most advantaged or the least advantaged members of society, they are motivated to create rules and practices that protect the interests of all, especially the worst-off. This perspective encourages the coexistence of freedom and equality, as it prompts decision-makers to consider society from the standpoint of all its members, ensuring fairness and justice for everyone regardless of their eventual position.",

For the video game , see Spirit of Speed 1937 . `` Spirit of Ecstasy '' on a Rolls - Royce Silver Cloud I , 1957 . `` Spirit of Ecstasy '' on a Rolls - Royce Corniche The Spirit of Ecstasy is the bonnet ornament on Rolls - Royce cars . It is in the form of a woman leaning forwards with her arms outstretched behind and above her . Billowing cloth runs from her arms to her back , resembling wings . Contents ( hide ) 1 History 1.1 The Whisper , precursor to the Spirit of Ecstasy 1.2 Modern ornament 2 Alterations 2.1 Kneeling version ( 1934 -- 1939 and 1946 -- 1956 ) 2.2 2003 -- present 3 Popular culture 4 References 5 External links History ( edit ) The Whisper , precursor to the Spirit of Ecstasy ( edit ) The very first Rolls - Royce motorcars did not feature radiator mascots ; they simply carried the Rolls - Royce emblem . When Montagu commissioned his friend , sculptor Charles Robinson Sykes , who worked in London under the nobleman 's patronage , to sculpt a personal mascot for the bonnet of his 1909 Rolls - Royce Silver Ghost , Sykes chose Eleanor Velasco Thornton as his model . Sykes originally crafted a figurine of her in fluttering robes , having placed one forefinger against her lips -- to symbolize the secret of their love affair . The figurine was consequently named The Whisper and is on display at the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu along with other Spirit of Ecstasy figurines . Only three or four castings were ever made , and only two are believed to have survived . Modern ornament ( edit ) Eleanor Velasco Thornton posing next to Montagu 's Silver Ghost , circa 1911 . On the bonnet is seen the Spirit of Ecstasy . The Spirit of Ecstasy , also called `` Emily '' , `` Silver Lady '' or `` Flying Lady '' , was designed by English sculptor Charles Robinson Sykes , a graduate of London 's Royal College of Art , and carries with it a story about secret passion between Montagu , second Baron Montagu of Beaulieu after 1905 , a pioneer of the automobile movement , and editor of The Car Illustrated magazine from 1902 , and the model for the emblem , Eleanor Velasco Thornton . Eleanor ( also known as Thorn ) was the secretary of John Walter , who fell in love with her in 1902 when she worked for him on the aforesaid motoring magazine . Their secret love was to remain hidden , limited to their circle of friends , for more than a decade . The reason for the secrecy was Eleanor 's impoverished social and economic status , which was an obstacle to their love . On the other hand , Montagu was married to Lady Cecil Victoria Constance Kerr since 1889 . Side view of `` The Spirit of Ecstasy '' ( 1972 Rolls - Royce Silver Shadow ) By 1910 personal mascots had become the fashion of the day . Rolls - Royce were concerned to note that some owners were affixing `` inappropriate '' ornaments to their cars . Claude Johnson , then managing director of Rolls - Royce Motor Cars , was asked to commission a more dignified and graceful mascot . He turned to Sykes to produce a mascot which would adorn all future Rolls - Royce cars and become generic to the marque , with the specifications that it should convey `` the spirit of the Rolls - Royce , namely , speed with silence , absence of vibration , the mysterious harnessing of great energy and a beautiful living organism of superb grace ... '' Sykes ' brief from Claude Johnson had been to evoke the spirit of mythical beauty , Nike , whose graceful image was admired in The Louvre , but Sykes was not impressed . He felt that a more feminine representation might be apt . It was again Miss Thornton whom he had in mind . Sykes chose to modify The Whisper into a version similar to today 's Spirit of Ecstasy . He called this first model The Spirit of Speed . Later , Charles Sykes called it `` A graceful little goddess , the Spirit of Ecstasy , who has selected road travel as her supreme delight and alighted on the prow of a Rolls - Royce motor car to revel in the freshness of the air and the musical sound of her fluttering draperies . '' Claude Johnson devised the description of The Spirit of Ecstasy , he described how Sykes had sought to convey the image of `` the spirit of ecstasy , who has selected road travel as her supreme delight ... she is expressing her keen enjoyment , with her arms outstretched and her sight fixed upon the distance . '' Royce was ill during the commissioning of the flying lady . He did not believe the figurine enhanced the cars , asserting that it impaired the driver 's view , and was rarely seen driving one of his company 's vehicles adorned with the mascot . In February 1911 Sykes presented to Rolls - Royce the `` Spirit of Ecstasy '' , which was easily recognisable as being a variation on the theme of `` The Whisper '' . The similarity was hardly coincidental because the model for both had been Miss Thornton . The sculptor 's signature appeared on the plinth and were either signed `` Charles Sykes , February 1911 '' or `` Feb 6 , 1911 '' or `` 6.2. 11 '' . Even after Rolls - Royce took over the casting of the figures in 1948 each Spirit of Ecstasy continued to receive this inscription until 1951 . The Spirit of Ecstasy was also manufactured by the British firm Louis Lejeune Ltd. for a number of years . Eleanor died on 30 December 1915 when the SS Persia was torpedoed by a U-boat south of Crete . She had been accompanying Lord Montagu who had been directed to assume a command in India . He was thought to have been killed too , but survived and was saved after several days adrift in a life raft . Alterations ( edit ) Royce made sure it was officially listed as an optional extra , but in practice it was fitted to almost all cars after that year , becoming a standard fitting in the early 1920s . It was silver plated from 1911 until 1914 when the mascot was made with nickel or chrome alloy to dissuade theft . The only departure from this came in Paris at the competition for the most apposite mascot of 1920 , where a gold - plated version won first place . Gold - plated versions were subsequently available at additional cost . The design of the mascot has had eleven main variations in its life . Lowered height of coachwork forced subsequent reductions in the mascot size . Consequently , several alterations in the original design were made . Kneeling version ( 1934 -- 1939 and 1946 -- 1956 ) ( edit ) Kneeling version of the spirit of ecstasy on a Phantom IV radiator . Sykes was once again commissioned by Rolls - Royce in the 1930s to make a lower version of the mascot to suit the needs of the new sports saloons by providing their drivers with a clearer view of the road ahead . The kneeling lady mascot was unveiled on 26 January 1934 and was as undeniably a reflection of Eleanor as it was a symbol of the Rolls - Royce . It also bore on the plinth the inscription `` C. Sykes , 26.1. 34 '' , the date when the first piece was finished . This version was , however , discontinued after the Silver Dawn , Phantom IV and Silver Wraith models , in favour of a smaller version of the original standing mascot , and so it remains to date .

            "page_content": "little goddess , the Spirit of Ecstasy , who has selected road travel as her supreme delight and alighted on the prow of a Rolls - Royce motor car to revel in the freshness of the air and the musical sound of her fluttering draperies . '' Claude Johnson devised the description of The Spirit of Ecstasy , he described how Sykes had sought to convey the image of `` the spirit of ecstasy , who has selected road travel as her supreme delight ... she is expressing her keen enjoyment , with her arms outstretched and her sight fixed upon the distance . '' Royce was ill during the commissioning of the flying lady . He did not believe the figurine enhanced the cars , asserting that it impaired the driver 's view , and was rarely seen driving one of his company 's vehicles adorned with the mascot . In February 1911 Sykes presented to Rolls - Royce the `` Spirit of Ecstasy '' , which was easily recognisable as being a variation on the theme of `` The Whisper '' . The similarity was hardly coincidental because the model for both had been Miss Thornton . The sculptor 's signature appeared on the plinth and were either signed `` Charles Sykes , February 1911 '' or `` Feb 6 , 1911 '' or `` 6.2. 11 '' . Even after Rolls - Royce took over the casting of the figures in 1948 each Spirit of Ecstasy continued to receive this inscription until 1951 . The Spirit of Ecstasy was also manufactured by the British firm Louis Lejeune Ltd. for a number of years . Eleanor died on 30 December 1915 when the SS Persia was torpedoed by a U-boat south of Crete . She had been accompanying Lord Montagu who had been directed to assume a command in India . He was thought to have been killed too , but survived and was saved after several days adrift in a life raft . Alterations Royce made sure it was officially listed as an optional extra , but in practice it was fitted to almost all cars after that year , becoming a standard fitting in the early 1920s . It was silver plated from 1911 until 1914 when the mascot was made with nickel or chrome alloy to dissuade theft . The only departure from this came in Paris at the competition for the most apposite mascot of 1920 , where a gold - plated version won first place . Gold - plated versions were subsequently available at additional cost . The design of the mascot has had eleven main variations in its life . Lowered height of coachwork forced subsequent reductions in the mascot size . Consequently , several alterations in the original design were made . Kneeling version ( 1934 -- 1939 and 1946 -- 1956 ) Kneeling version of the spirit of ecstasy on a Phantom IV radiator . Sykes was once again commissioned by Rolls - Royce in the 1930s to make a lower version of the mascot to suit the needs of the new sports saloons by providing their drivers with a clearer view of the road ahead . The kneeling lady mascot was unveiled on 26 January 1934 and was as undeniably a reflection of Eleanor as it was a symbol of the Rolls - Royce . It also bore on the plinth the inscription `` C. Sykes , 26.1. 34 '' , the date when the first piece was finished . This version was , however , discontinued after the Silver Dawn , Phantom IV and Silver Wraith models , in favour of a smaller version of the original standing mascot , and so it remains to date . The last Phantom IV delivered and the final 4 or 5 years of the Silver Wraith carried this standing version . 2003 -- present Today 's Spirit of Ecstasy , from the 2003 Phantom model onward , stands at 3 inches and , for safety , is mounted on a spring - loaded mechanism designed to retract instantly into the radiator shell if struck from any direction . There is a button within the vehicle which can raise / lower the emblem when pressed .

The 416 & Burro Fire Complex are active wildfires in the southwestern portion of Colorado in the United States . The fires are predominately within San Juan National Forest , 13 miles north of Durango and 14 miles south of Rico . The 416 fire started on June 1 , 2018 and the Burro Fire followed on June 8th . The causes are still under investigation . As of July 2 , 2018 the fires have burned a combined total of over 55,000 acres ( 22,258 ha ) and have cost more than $27 million to contain . It is one of the largest wildfires in Colorado 's history and has had major impacts on tourism and commerce for communities in the southwest portion of the state . Contents 1 Events 1.1 June 1.2 July 2 Impact 3 Closures 4 References 5 External links Events ( edit ) June ( edit ) The 416 Fire started around 10 : 00 a.m. on June 1 , 2018 , approximately 10 miles north of Durango , Colorado , near the train tracks of the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gage Railroad and west of Highway 550 . By the morning of June 2 , the fire had expanded into the San Juan National Forest and had burned an estimated 1,100 acres ( 445 ha ) . The highway was closed between milemarkers 34 and 48 for public safety and to allow firefighters to keep the fire from crossing the highway . County Road 250 was also closed . Evacuation orders were put in place for residents of Baker 's Bridge at County Road 250 north to Electra Lake Road , where 825 structures are threatened . By the evening of June 3 , the fire had grown to 2,255 acres ( 913 ha ) and was 10 percent contained . It expanded Hermosa Creek , prompting officials to issue pre-evacuation orders to the community of Hermosa . The next day , the fire showed significant activity due to winds . Highway 550 was again closed due to heavy smoke and fire teams focused on building defensible spaces around buildings and using controlled burns as needed . The fire is at 10 percent containment . By June 5 , new pre-evacuation orders were put in place for areas east of Hermosa due to southerly winds keeping the flames on the ridgeline on the slopes near the community . Temperatures were hotter than average and Forest Service personnel cited increased drought conditions as creating additional challenges . Crews continued to fight the fire using aerial support . The Burrow Fire began on the opposite side of the Hermosa Creek Wilderness Area on June 8th . As of July 2 , 2018 the fire had spread to within 10 miles of the 416 fire and burned over 4,000 acres ( 1,619 ha ) . By June 29 , the 416 fire had expanded to 41,617 acres ( 16,842 ha ) and was 37 percent contained . The fire continued moving north , with crews clearing and chipping brush piles along the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad . Burnouts continued in the southwest in No Buck Creek . July ( edit ) By July 1 , the fire had grown to 49,301 acres ( 19,951 ha ) and was 37 percent contained . Temperatures enabled crews to focus on containment in the south and southwestern side of the fire , while northwest winds caused smokey conditions for communities along Highway 550 , including Durango and Hermosa Creek . Concerns about the fire impacting the Purgatory Resort were reduced , however hotshot crews remained in the area to protect the resort , if needed . Impact ( edit ) Over 1300 homes and businesses were forced to evacuate due to the fire . As of July 2 , no businesses or homes have been destroyed by the fire . The fire forced the closure of Purgatory Ski Resort , Durango and Silverton Narrow Gage Railroad , and the San Juan National Forest , as well as sporadic closures of Highway 550 . The town of Silverton had to cancel their famed 4th of July Fireworks , which brings thousands of visitors to the tiny mountain town . Railroad tourism regained operation in July with diesel locomotives and steam engine services to Silverton resume on July 17th . Purgatory resumed its summer operations on July 2nd The July 4th cancelations and highway , rail , and trail closures have devastated the tourism industry of Silverton , and has had a substantial impact on the economies of Durango and elsewhere in southwest Colorado . Closures ( edit ) Areas of San Juan National Forest are closed , specifically : All trails that tie into the Colorado Trail off of Highway 550 from the Molas Trailhead south to the Junction Creek Trailhead References ( edit ) Jump up ^ `` 416 Fire '' .

Temperatures enabled crews to focus on containment in the south and southwestern side of the fire , while northwest winds caused smokey conditions for communities along Highway 550 , including Durango and Hermosa Creek . Concerns about the fire impacting the Purgatory Resort were reduced , however hotshot crews remained in the area to protect the resort , if needed . Impact Over 1300 homes and businesses were forced to evacuate due to the fire . As of July 2 , no businesses or homes have been destroyed by the fire . The fire forced the closure of Purgatory Ski Resort , Durango and Silverton Narrow Gage Railroad , and the San Juan National Forest , as well as sporadic closures of Highway 550 . The town of Silverton had to cancel their famed 4th of July Fireworks , which brings thousands of visitors to the tiny mountain town . Railroad tourism regained operation in July with diesel locomotives and steam engine services to Silverton resume on July 17th . Purgatory resumed its summer operations on July 2nd The July 4th cancelations and highway , rail , and trail closures have devastated the tourism industry of Silverton , and has had a substantial impact on the economies of Durango and elsewhere in southwest Colorado .

    "title": "Oncogene",
    "document": "Oncogene - wikipedia Oncogene For the journal , see Oncogene ( journal ) . Illustration of how a normal cell is converted to a cancer cell , when an oncogene becomes activated An oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer . In tumor cells , they are often mutated and / or expressed at high levels . Most normal cells will undergo a programmed form of rapid cell death ( apoptosis ) when critical functions are altered and malfunctioning . Activated oncogenes can cause those cells designated for apoptosis to survive and proliferate instead . Most oncogenes began as proto - oncogenes , normal genes involved in cell growth and proliferation or inhibition of apoptosis . If normal genes promoting cellular growth , through mutation , are up - regulated , ( gain of function mutation ) they will predispose the cell to cancer and are thus termed oncogenes . Usually multiple oncogenes , along with mutated apoptotic and / or tumor suppressor genes will all act in concert to cause cancer . Since the 1970s , dozens of oncogenes have been identified in human cancer . Many cancer drugs target the proteins encoded by oncogenes . Contents 1 History 2 Proto - oncogene 2.1 Activation 3 Classification 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History ( edit ) The theory of oncogenes was foreshadowed by the German biologist Theodor Boveri in his 1914 book Zur Frage der Entstehung Maligner Tumoren ( ' The Origin of Malignant Tumours ' ) , Gustav Fisher , Jena , 1914 . Oncogenes ( Teilungsfoerdernde Chromosomen ) that become amplified ( im permanenten Übergewicht ) during tumour development . Later on the term `` oncogene '' was rediscovered in 1969 by National Cancer Institute scientists George Todaro and Robert Heubner . The first confirmed oncogene was discovered in 1970 and was termed src ( pronounced sarc as in sarcoma ) . Src was in fact first discovered as an oncogene in a chicken retrovirus . Experiments performed by Dr. G. Steve Martin of the University of California , Berkeley demonstrated that the Src was indeed the oncogene of the virus . The first nucleotide sequence of v - src was sequenced in 1980 by A.P. Czernilofsky et al . In 1976 Drs . Dominique Stehelin , J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus of the University of California , San Francisco demonstrated that oncogenes were activated proto - oncogenes , found in many organisms including humans . Bishop and Varmus were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1989 for their discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes . The resultant protein encoded by an oncogene is termed oncoprotein . Oncogenes play an important role in the regulation or synthesis of proteins linked to tumorigenic cell growth . Some oncoproteins are accepted and used as tumor markers . The Spanish biochemist Mariano Barbacid isolated the first oncogene . His discovery was published in the prestigious journal Nature in 1982 in an article titled `` A point mutation is responsible for the acquisition of transforming properties by the T24 human bladder - carcinoma oncogene '' . He spent the following months extending his research , eventually discovering that such oncogene was the mutation of an allele of the Ras subfamily , as well as its activation mechanism . Proto - oncogene ( edit ) A proto - oncogene is a normal gene that could become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression . Proto - oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate the cell growth and differentiation . Proto - oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals , usually through their protein products . Upon acquiring an activating mutation , a proto - oncogene becomes a tumor - inducing agent , an oncogene . Examples of proto - oncogenes include RAS , WNT , MYC , ERK , and TRK . The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt 's lymphoma , which starts when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence within the vicinity of the MYC gene . The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors . When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed , these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates . Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr - Abl gene found on the Philadelphia chromosome , a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22 . Bcr - Abl codes for a tyrosine kinase , which is constitutively active , leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation . ( More information about the Philadelphia Chromosome below ) Activation ( edit ) From proto - oncogene to oncogene The proto - oncogene can become an oncogene by a relatively small modification of its original function . There are three basic methods of activation : A mutation within a proto - oncogene , or within a regulatory region ( for example the promoter region ) , can cause a change in the protein structure , causing an increase in protein ( enzyme ) activity a loss of regulation An increase in the amount of a certain protein ( protein concentration ) , caused by an increase of protein expression ( through misregulation ) an increase of protein ( mRNA ) stability , prolonging its existence and thus its activity in the cell gene duplication ( one type of chromosome abnormality ) , resulting in an increased amount of protein in the cell A chromosomal translocation ( another type of chromosome abnormality ) There are 2 different types of chromosomal translocations that can occur : translocation events which relocate a proto - oncogene to a new chromosomal site that leads to higher expression translocation events that lead to a fusion between a proto - oncogene and a 2nd gene ( this creates a fusion protein with increased cancerous / oncogenic activity ) the expression of a constitutively active hybrid protein . This type of mutation in a dividing stem cell in the bone marrow leads to adult leukemia Philadelphia Chromosome is an example of this type of translocation event . This chromosome was discovered in 1960 by Peter Nowell and David Hungerford , and it is a fusion of parts of DNA from chromosome 22 and chromosome 9 . The broken end of chromosome 22 contains the `` BCR '' gene , which fuses with a fragment of chromosome 9 that contains the `` ABL1 '' gene . When these two chromosome fragments fuse the genes also fuse creating a new gene : `` BCR - ABL '' . This fused gene encodes for a protein that displays high protein tyrosine kinase activity ( this activity is due to the `` ABL1 '' half of the protein ) . The unregulated expression of this protein activates other proteins that are involved in cell cycle and cell division which can cause a cell to grow and divide uncontrollably ( the cell becomes cancerous ) . As a result , the Philadelphia Chromosome is associated with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ( as mentioned before ) as well as other forms of Leukemia . The expression of oncogenes can be regulated by microRNAs ( miRNAs ) , small RNAs 21 - 25 nucleotides in length that control gene expression by downregulating them . Mutations in such microRNAs ( known as oncomirs ) can lead to activation of oncogenes . Antisense messenger RNAs could theoretically be used to block the effects of oncogenes . Classification ( edit ) There are several systems for classifying oncogenes , but there is not yet a widely accepted standard . They are sometimes grouped both spatially ( moving from outside the cell inwards ) and chronologically ( parallelling the `` normal '' process of signal transduction ) . There are several categories that are commonly used : Category Examples Cancers Gene functions Growth factors , or mitogens c - Sis glioblastomas , fibrosarcomas , osteosarcomas , breast carcinomas , and melanomas induces cell proliferation . Receptor tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , platelet - derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , HER2 / neu Breast cancer , gastrointestinal stromal tumours , non-small - cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer transduce signals for cell growth and differentiation . Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases Src - family , Syk - ZAP - 70 family , and BTK family of tyrosine kinases , the Abl gene in CML - Philadelphia chromosome colorectal and breast cancers , melanomas , ovarian cancers , gastric cancers , head and neck cancers , pancreatic cancer , lung cancer , brain cancers , and blood cancers mediate the responses to , and the activation receptors of cell proliferation , migration , differentiation , and survival Cytoplasmic Serine / threonine kinases and their regulatory subunits Raf kinase , and cyclin - dependent kinases ( through overexpression ) . malignant melanoma , papillary thyroid cancer , colorectal cancer , and ovarian cancer Involved in organism development , cell cycle regulation , cell proliferation , differentiation , cells survival , and apoptosis Regulatory GTPases Ras protein adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and colon , thyroid tumors , and myeloid leukemia involved in signalling a major pathway leading to cell proliferation . Transcription factors myc gene malignant T - cell lymphomas and acute myleoid leukemias , breast cancer , pancreatic cancer , retinoblastoma , and small cell lung cancer - They regulate transcription of genes that induce cell proliferation . Additional oncogenetic regulator properties include : Growth factors are usually secreted by either specialized or non-specialized cells to induce cell proliferation in themselves , nearby cells , or distant cells . An oncogene may cause a cell to secrete growth factors even though it does not normally do so . It will thereby induce its own uncontrolled proliferation ( autocrine loop ) , and proliferation of neighboring cells , possibly leading to tumor formation . It may also cause production of growth hormones in other parts of the body . Receptor tyrosine kinases add phosphate groups to other proteins in order to turn them on or off . Receptor kinases add phosphate groups to receptor proteins at the surface of the cell ( which receives protein signals from outside the cell and transmits them to the inside of the cell ) . Tyrosine kinases add phosphate groups to the amino acid tyrosine in the target protein . They can cause cancer by turning the receptor permanently on ( constitutively ) , even without signals from outside the cell . Ras is a small GTPase that hydrolyses GTP into GDP and phosphate . Ras is activated by growth factor signaling ( i.e. , EGF , TGFbeta ) and acting like a binary switch ( on / off ) in growth signaling pathways . Downstream effectors of Ras include three mitogen - activated protein kinases Raf a MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase ( MAPKKK ) , MEK a MAP Kinase Kinase ( MAPKK ) , and ERK a MAP Kinase ( MAPK ) , which in turn regulate genes that mediate cell proliferation .

Mutations in such microRNAs ( known as oncomirs ) can lead to activation of oncogenes . Antisense messenger RNAs could theoretically be used to block the effects of oncogenes . Classification There are several systems for classifying oncogenes , but there is not yet a widely accepted standard . They are sometimes grouped both spatially ( moving from outside the cell inwards ) and chronologically ( parallelling the `` normal '' process of signal transduction ) . There are several categories that are commonly used : Category Examples Cancers Gene functions Growth factors , or mitogens c - Sis glioblastomas , fibrosarcomas , osteosarcomas , breast carcinomas , and melanomas induces cell proliferation . Receptor tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , platelet - derived growth",

The undulating relief and hard rocks make it difficult to dig canals and wells . 2 . There is little percolation of rain water due to hard rock structures and ground water is not available in large quantities . 3 . Most of the rivers of this region are seasonal and dry up during summer season . Therefore , they can not supply water to canals throughout the year . 4 . There are several streams which become torrential during rainy season . The only way to make best use of this water is to impound it by constructing embankments and building tanks . Otherwise this water would go to waste and into the sea . 5 . The scattered nature of population and agricultural fields also favours tank irrigation . Merits of tank irrigation ( edit ) Most of the tanks are natural and do not involve heavy cost for their construction . Even an individual farmer can have his own tank . Tanks are generally constructed on rocky bed and have longer life span . In many tanks , fishing is also carried on . This supplements both the food resources and income of the farmer . Demerits of tank irrigation ( edit ) Many tanks dry up during the dry season and fail to provide irrigation when it is needed the most . Silting of the tank bed is a serious problem and it requires desilting of the tank at regular intervals . Much water is evaporated from the large expanse of shallow water and is thus not available for irrigation . Tanks cover large areas of cultivable land . In many areas , other sources of irrigation have been adopted and the dry beds of tanks have been reclaimed for agriculture . Moreover , lifting of water from tanks and carrying it to the fields is a strenuous and costly exercise which discourages the use of tanks as a source of irrigation . Tank design ( edit ) Water is considered a purifying and regenerative element in India , and is an essential element of prayer and ritual . Water is also revered because of its scarcity in western India where dry and monsoon seasons alternate and failure of the monsoon season means famine and death while plentiful water replacing irrigations sources is a time of rejoicing . This resulted in building water storage tanks that combined the practical and sacred . Since ancient times , the design of water storage has been important in Indian architecture . As early as 3000 BC , sophisticated systems of drains , wells and tanks were built to conserve and utilise water . Tank building as an art form began with the Hindus and developed under Muslim rule . An example of the art of tank design is the large , geometically spectacular Stepped Tank at the Royal Center at the ruins of Vijayanagara , the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire , surrounding the modern town of Hampi . It is lined with green diorite and has no drain . The tank was filled by aqueduct . Village tanks ( edit ) A tank in Tamil Nadu Ralegaon Siddhi is an example of a village that revitalised its ancient tank system . In 1975 the village was drought - stricken . The village tank could not hold water as the earthen embankment dam wall leaked . Work began with the percolation tank construction by the villagers who donated their labor to repair the embankment . Once this was fixed , the village 's seven wells below the tank filled with water in the summer for the first time in memory . Now the village has a supply of water throughout the year . Temple tanks ( edit ) Tanks known as `` Pushkarni '' or `` Kalyani '' also known as `` Kund '' in Hindi are reservoirs with steps leading down to the water , generally found in South India , and sometimes constructed within the walls of a temple complex . Bathing in the sacred waters of a temple tank was believed to cure worshippers of afflictions such as leprosy and blindness . Many temple tanks are decaying and drying up today . Stepwells ( edit ) Stepwells , also called bavdi ( Hindi : बावड़ी ) or bavli ( Hindi : बावली ) , are wells in which the water can be reached by descending a set of steps . They are most common in the west of India . Stepwells were often used for leisure , providing relief from daytime heat . This led to the building of some significant ornamental and architectural features , often associated with dwellings and in urban areas . It also ensured their survival as monuments . Modern tank management ( edit ) The development of large - scale water management methods and hydroelectric generation have replaced much of the local efforts and community management of water . For example , the state of Karnataka has about 44,000 artificial wetlands locally constructed over many centuries . At least 328 are threatened today . However , recently a tank regeneration movement initiated by communities and non-governmental organisations ( NGO ) has arisen . Today , there are approximately 120,000 small - scale tanks , irrigating about 41,200 km2 in semi-arid areas of India . This constitutes about one third of the total irrigated land in South India .

Demerits of tank irrigation Many tanks dry up during the dry season and fail to provide irrigation when it is needed the most . Silting of the tank bed is a serious problem and it requires desilting of the tank at regular intervals . Much water is evaporated from the large expanse of shallow water and is thus not available for irrigation . Tanks cover large areas of cultivable land . In many areas , other sources of irrigation have been adopted and the dry beds of tanks have been reclaimed for agriculture . Moreover , lifting of water from tanks and carrying it to the fields is a strenuous and costly exercise which discourages the use of tanks as a source of irrigation . Tank design Water is considered a purifying and regenerative element in India , and is an essential element of prayer and ritual . Water is also revered because of its scarcity in western India where dry and monsoon seasons alternate and failure of the monsoon season means famine and death while plentiful water replacing irrigations sources is a time of rejoicing . This resulted in building water storage tanks that combined the practical and sacred . Since ancient times , the design of water storage has been important in Indian architecture . As early as 3000 BC , sophisticated systems of drains , wells and tanks were built to conserve and utilise water . Tank",

Notable work Truth Does n't Have a Side : My Alarming Discovery about the Danger of Contact Sports Spouse ( s ) Prema Mutiso Children Website www.bennetomalu.com Bennet Ifeakandu Omalu ( born September 1968 ) is a Nigerian - American physician , forensic pathologist , and neuropathologist who was the first to discover and publish findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) in American football players while working at the Allegheny County Coroner 's Office in Pittsburgh . He later became the chief medical examiner for San Joaquin County , California , and is a professor at the University of California , Davis , Department of Medical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine . Contents ( hide ) 1 Early life 2 Education and career 3 Research on CTE 4 In popular media 5 Personal life 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Early life ( edit ) Omalu was born in Nnokwa , Idemili South , Anambra in southeastern Nigeria on September 30 , 1968 , the sixth of seven siblings . He was born during the Nigerian Civil War , which caused his family to flee from their home in the predominantly Igbo village of Enugu - Ukwu in southeastern Nigeria . They returned two years after Omalu 's birth . Omalu 's mother was a seamstress and his father a civil mining engineer and community leader in Enugu - Ukwu . The family name , Omalu , is a shortened form of the surname , Onyemalukwube , which translates to `` he who knows , speak . '' Education and career ( edit ) Omalu began primary school at age three and earned entrance into the Federal Government College Enugu for secondary school . He attended medical school starting at age 16 at the University of Nigeria , Nsukka . After graduating with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery ( MBBS ) in June 1990 , he completed a clinical internship , followed by three years of service work doctoring in the highland city of Jos . He became disillusioned with Nigeria after presidential candidate Moshood Abiola failed to win the Nigerian presidency during an inconclusive election in 1993 and began to search for scholarship opportunities in the United States . Omalu first came to Seattle , Washington in 1994 to complete an epidemiology fellowship at the University of Washington . In 1995 , he left Seattle for New York City , where he joined Columbia University 's Harlem Hospital Center for a residency training program in anatomic and clinical pathology . After residency , he trained as a forensic pathologist under noted forensic consultant Cyril Wecht at the Allegheny County Coroner 's Office in Pittsburgh . Omalu became particularly interested in neuropathology . Omalu holds eight advanced degrees and board certifications , later receiving fellowships in pathology and neuropathology through the University of Pittsburgh in 2000 and 2002 respectively , a Master of Public Health ( MPH ) in epidemiology in 2004 from University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health , and a Master of Business Administration ( MBA ) from Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University in 2008 . Omalu served as chief medical examiner of San Joaquin County , California from 2007 until he resigned in 2017 after accusing the county 's Sheriff , who doubles as Coroner , of repeatedly interfering with death investigations to protect law enforcement officers who killed people . An assistant forensic pathologist who joined the office for the opportunity to work with Omalu resigned a few days earlier citing similar allegations . Omalu is a professor in the UC Davis Department of Medical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine . Research on CTE ( edit ) Main articles : Concussions in American football , Concussions in sport , and Chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) Omalu 's autopsy of former Pittsburgh Steelers player Mike Webster in 2002 led to the re-emergence of awareness of a neurologic condition associated with chronic head trauma called chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or CTE , which had been previously described in boxers and other professional athletes . Webster had died suddenly and unexpectedly following years of struggling with cognitive and intellectual impairment , destitution , mood disorders , depression , drug abuse , and suicide attempts . Although Webster 's brain looked normal at autopsy , Omalu conducted independent and self - financed tissue analyses . He suspected that Webster suffered from dementia pugilistica , which is a form of dementia that is induced by repeated blows to the head , a condition found previously in boxers . Using specialized staining , Omalu found large accumulations of tau protein in Webster 's brain , which affect mood , emotions , and executive functions similar to the way that clumps of beta - amyloid protein contribute to Alzheimer 's disease . Together with colleagues in the Department of Pathology at the University of Pittsburgh , Omalu published his findings in the journal Neurosurgery in 2005 in a paper titled `` Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in a National Football League Player . '' In it , Omalu called for further study of the disease : `` We herein report the first documented case of long - term neurodegenerative changes in a retired professional NFL player consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) . This case draws attention to a disease that remains inadequately studied in the cohort of professional football players , with unknown true prevalence rates . '' Omalu believed the National Football League ( NFL ) doctors would be `` pleased '' to read it and that his research could be used to `` fix the problem . '' The paper received little attention initially , but members of the NFL 's Mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( MTBI ) Committee later called for its retraction in May 2006 . Their letter requesting the retraction characterized Omalu 's description of CTE as `` completely wrong '' and called the paper `` a failure . '' Omalu later partnered with Julian Bailes , a neurosurgeon , concussion researcher , and then chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery at West Virginia University School of Medicine , and West Virginia attorney Robert P. Fitzsimmons to found the Brain Injury Research Institute which established a brain and tissue bank . In November 2006 , Omalu published a second Neurosurgery paper based on his findings in the brain of former NFL player Terry Long , who suffered from depression and committed suicide in 2005 . Though Long died at 45 , Omalu found tau protein concentrations more consistent with `` a 90 - year - old brain with advanced Alzheimer 's . '' As with Mike Webster , Omalu asserted that Long 's football career had caused later brain damage and depression . Omalu also found evidence of CTE in the brains of retired NFL players Justin Strzelczyk ( d . 2004 at 36 years old ) , Andre Waters ( d . 2006 at 44 ) , and Tom McHale ( d . 2008 at 45 ) . In summer 2007 , Bailes presented his and Omalu 's findings to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell at a league - wide concussion summit . Bailes later said that the research was `` dismissed '' . The NFL 's MTBI committee chair , Dr. Ira Casson , told the press : `` In my opinion , the only scientifically valid evidence of a chronic encephalopathy in athletes is in boxers and in some Steeplechase jockeys . '' The NFL did not publicly acknowledge the link between concussions sustained in football and long - term neurological effects until December 2009 , seven years after Omalu 's discovery . However , as late as 2013 , the annual meeting of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology ( AACN ) included a debate between two sports concussion experts regarding the validity ( or existence ) of CTE . Finally , in March 2016 , the NFL 's senior vice president for health and safety policy , Jeff Miller , testified before congress that the NFL now believed that there was a link between football and CTE . Omalu has also discovered CTE in the brains of military veterans , publishing the first documented case in a November 2011 article . Omalu found evidence of CTE in a 27 - year - old Iraq War veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and later committed suicide . Omalu 's paper links PTSD to the CTE spectrum of diseases and calls for further study . Omalu is lead author in a study published in November 2017 that for the first time confirmed CTE in a living person . A chemical tracer , FDDNP , binds to tau proteins , detectable by positron emission tomography , and associated with the distinctive topographical distributions characteristic of CTE . Tested on at least a dozen former NFL players , it was confirmed postmortem in former linebacker Fred McNeill . In popular media ( edit ) Omalu 's efforts to study and publicize CTE in the face of NFL opposition were reported in a GQ magazine article in 2009 by journalist Jeanne Marie Laskas . The article was later expanded by Laskas into a book , Concussion ( Penguin Random House , 2015 ) , and adapted into a film of the same name where Omalu , portrayed by Will Smith , is the central character . The film has been criticized for not being truthful to the actual events . Nevertheless , the movie 's production led to the creation of a foundation named after Omalu to advance CTE and concussion research . In September 2016 , Omalu attracted media attention when he suggested on Twitter that Hillary Clinton was possibly poisoned and advised members of her presidential campaign to `` perform toxicologic analysis of Ms. Clinton 's blood . '' He further tweeted , `` I do not trust Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump . With those two , all things are possible . '' Omalu 's book Truth Does n't Have a Side : My Alarming Discovery about the Danger of Contact Sports was published in August 2017 by HarperCollins . He previously wrote Play Hard , Die Young : Football Dementia , Depression , and Death , published in 2008 . Personal life ( edit ) Omalu is married to Prema Mutiso , originally from Kenya . They live in Lodi , California and have two children , Ashly and Mark . He is a practicing Catholic and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February 2015 .

    "document": "Mach Five - wikipedia Mach Five Jump to : navigation , search For the song by The Presidents of the United States of America , see Mach 5 ( song ) . For the Mach speed rating system , see Mach number . Speed Racer at the wheel of his vehicle , The Mach Five The Mach Five ( マッハ 号 , Mahha - gō ) is the racing car Speed Racer ( Go Mifune in the Japanese version ) drives in the anime series of the same name ( known as `` Mach Go ! Go ! Go ! '' in Japan ) . The car was designed , built , and created by `` Pops Racer '' ( Daisuke Mifune ) , Speed Racer 's father . It features a set of special devices which Speed Racer uses throughout the series . In the original 1967 series , the Mach Five is a white racing car with an `` M '' written on its hood ( which does not stand for `` Mach 5 '' , but instead stands for `` Mifune '' , both Go 's last name , and the name of his father 's motor company ) . In the 1993 American remake , the design was completely changed . Its name probably derives from the fact that speeds above Mach 5 are known as hypersonic . However , the Mach Five can not reach Mach speeds . The name is also a pun in two languages : the word for `` five '' in Japanese is `` go '' . However , the `` go '' used for the car 's name is a suffix attached to the names of ships , etc . Thus , the car is known in the Japanese version as simply the `` Mach '' . Actual race cars that closely resemble the Mach Five are the 1966 Japanese Grand Prix - winning Prince R380 ( 1965 ) / Nissan R380 - II ( 1966 - 68 ) , the Le Mans - winners Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa ( designed by Scaglietti around 1958 through 1961 ) , the Aston Martin DBR1 ( Le Mans winner in 1959 ) , the Ford GT40 ( which was a very popular and successful racecar , mainly in Le Mans and other Touring series , in the 1960s ) , and the Chaparral 2C . Though perhaps most similar of all is the 1968 Ferrari 250 P5 , designed by Pininfarina . The car is designed to compete in a type of `` open formula '' racing , where cars are usually built with the maximum power and minimum of weight . Contents ( hide ) 1 Special features 2 Speed Racer X 3 The New Adventures of Speed Racer 4 The `` Real '' Mach Five 5 Portrayal in film 6 Speed Racer : The Next Generation 7 Mach Five in popular culture 8 References 9 External links Special features ( edit ) The Mach Five 's steering wheel hub . The car has seven mechanisms triggered by buttons labeled from A to G on the steering wheel hub . Their functions ( and names , taken from the Japanese production ) are : Button A , Auto Jack ( オート ジャッキ , Ōto Jakki , Auto Jack ) : Releases four jacks to boost the car up so that it can be repaired . Although designed for this function , the auto jacks are more often used to jump the car short distances , as a wedge to keep the car from toppling over a waterfall , or as an alternative braking system . The spring - like sound the jacks make is distinctive to the show . Button B , Belt Tires ( ベルト タイヤ , Beruto Taiya , Belt Tire ) : Sprouts special grip tires for traction over any kind of terrain ( firm , icy , or unsteady ground ; ocean floor ; vertical mountainsides ) . At the same time , 5,000 horsepower ( 3,700 kW ) is distributed evenly to all four wheels ( 1,250 hp / 932.13 kW ) . Button C , Cutter Blades ( カッター , Kattā , Cutter ) : Powerful rotary saws protrude from the front of the Mach Five to remove obstacles in its way such as trees . Mostly used for racing in forest areas ( especially when Speed gets forced off the road ) . Button D , Deflector ( ディ フェンサー , Difensā , Defensor ) : Releases a powerful deflector which seals the cockpit in a bullet - proof and crash - proof , and either an air - tight or water - tight chamber depending on the environment around the car . Inside it , the car driver is completely invulnerable . Button E , Evening or Illuminating Eye or Special Illumination ( イブニング アイ , Ibuningu Ai , Evening Eye ) : The control for special illumination which can be traversed singly or in tandem , and which enables to see much farther and more clearly than with ordinary headlights . When used with the `` night shades '' attached to Speed 's helmet , his vision is enhanced with infrared light . Button E was later modified to activate mini-wings ( Pops got the idea from the Car Acrobatic Team ) that would slide out from under the car to assist Speed in long jumps . Button F , Frogger Mode ( フロッガー , Furoggā , Frogger ) : Used when the Mach Five is under water . First , the cockpit is supplied with oxygen . Then , a periscope is raised to scan the surface of the water . Everything that is seen is relayed down to the driver 's seat by television . The 100 - pound ( 45 kg ) auxiliary supply of oxygen is enough to last for thirty minutes . Button G , Go Homing Robot ( ギズモ 号 , Gizumo - gō , Gizmo ) : Releases a homing robot bird from the front of the car . The homing robot bird can fly and can carry pictures or tape recorded messages , handwritten messages , X-ray film , rope , and small Egyptian statues , and it has been used as a last resort as a makeshift weapon for means of defense . The bird - like device is operated by a built - in remote control within the cockpit . Button H , Homing Device ( ホーミング , Hōmingu , Homing ) : This button is , unlike the other buttons , not located on the steering wheel ; instead is located on a console between the seats . Button H is part of the Go Homing Robot 's controls , and it simply sends the robot `` home '' to a pre-programmed location , usually Speed 's house . The Mach Five also has a small trunk , which is unusual in a race car but was featured in many episodes , often as a hiding place for main characters Spritle ( Kurio Mifune ) and Chim - Chim ( Senpei ) . While the original manga features many of the above functions seen in the anime , and while there are buttons on the steering wheel , it does not `` codify '' the functions in any way , making the letter designations exclusive to the anime . Speed Racer X ( edit ) In Speed Racer X ( not to be confused with the 1993 Fred Wolf remake ) , the buttons had name changes , and sometimes function changes : Button A , Aero Jack ( エアロ ジャッキ , Earojakki ) : Similar to the Auto - Jacks , but uses compressed air and rocket thrusters to propel the car into the air , rather than actual metal jacks ( making `` Aero Jack '' a bit of a misnomer ) . Unlike the original series , this can only be used to make the car jump . This function actually appears in the original manga replacing the original Auto Jacks . Button B , Balloon Tire ( バルーン タイヤ , Barūn Taiya ) : Inflates the tires like balloons , giving them better traction ( similar to monster truck tires ) , as well as allowing the Mach 5 to float on water . Button C , Cutter Blade ( カッター ブレード , Kattā Burēdo ) : Instead of saws , this button activates laser `` blades '' to cut through obstacles . Button D , Defense Shield ( ディフェンス シールド , Difensu Shīrudo ) : Closes the cockpit in a bulletproof protective dome , like the original series . Button E , Emergency Wire ( エマージェンシー ワイヤー , Emājenshī Waiyā ) : Completely different from the original series , this shoots out a rope and grappling hook to snag objects , either to keep the Mach 5 from falling into dangerous situations , or to hoist itself out of them . Button F , Fish Diver ( フィッシュ ダイバー , Fisshu Daibā ) : Functionally identical to Frogger Mode , but causes a M.A.S.K. - like physical transformation in the car , the wheels folding in and maneuverability fins sprouting . Button G , The Gallant ( ギャラント 号 , Gyaranto - gō ) : Again , identical to the Gizmo Rocket , but with a new name . The new adventures of Speed Racer ( edit ) The steering wheel of the Mach Five in this series had eight unmarked rectangular buttons , arranged in two columns of four on either side of the steering wheel 's center . The car appeared to have the same functions as the Mach Five in the original series , but the buttons Speed pressed to activate them seemed more or less random , with the same button activating different abilities ( or different buttons activating the same ability ) in different episodes . The `` real '' Mach Five ( edit ) Mach 5 replica at Fourth of July parade in 2015 Northville , Michigan In 2000 , a prototype Mach Five with actual cutting blades was produced as a concept car . 100 production models were planned to be made in 2002 as a street legal vehicle . Built on a 2001 Chevrolet Corvette Chassis , the body was to be extensively modified to look like the Mach Five . It was to have 345 horsepower , and cost between $75,000 and $125,000 each . The Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles , California has a mid-engine prototype of the Mach Fives in its collection . Portrayal in film ( edit ) Main article : Speed Racer ( film ) The Mach Five appears in the live - action film adaptation Speed Racer , directed by the Wachowski brothers , produced by Joel Silver , and released by Warner Bros. Pictures . The Mach Five is an actual vehicle and used in the major race of the film . Instead of being driven on pavement , it was hung from a crane and had its effects computer - generated . Along with the Mach Five , the movie features the `` Mach 4 '' and the `` Mach 6 '' , two different single - seater cars created specifically for stunt races . The designs of the Mach 4 and Mach 6 are vaguely reminiscent of the Mach Five 's ( as in the original American comics ) , although the only functions the Mach 6 features are the jump jacks , which are standard equipment in race cars in the movie . Little about the Mach 4 is known , as it appears only briefly in the film and is portrayed as a red - colored companion to the 6 . The film portrays the Mach Five as initially being a regular everyday vehicle , justifying the existence of its trunk door ( rather than having it serve solely as an excuse for Spritle and Chim - Chim to stow away in the vehicle ) . The Mach Five is later modified with gadgets and becomes Speed 's alternate car for off - track races such as the Casa Cristo 5000 , as well as everyday driving like a normal car . The Mach Five originally belonged to Speed 's older brother Rex , who relinquished ownership of it to Speed before he left the Racer home . Speed 's main car for races on the WRL track ( Thunderhead , etc . ) is the Mach 6 . The Mach 6 was destroyed in a fixed race , but was later rebuilt for the film 's final race . The steering wheel hub is still present on this version of the Mach Five . Although most of the original functions of the car are still intact , some are activated by different buttons . The underwater functions are abandoned completely and replaced with new functions exclusive to racing combat . Instead of being built with these features from the beginning , the special functions were added to the Mach Five in order to enter it in the Casa Cristo 5000 . The features that are still kept in this incarnation are : Auto Jacks Grip Tires ( Not as belt tires but as crampon tire spikes . ) Deflector Rotary Saws Homing Robot The functions abandoned in this version of the Mach Five are : Frogger Mode Evening Eye The functions on this Mach Five are : ( * ) New functions are represented with Bold Italics . Control A = Jump Jacks ( Originally called the Auto Jacks ) When pressed , the car releases and immediately retracts long automated car jacks that make the car jump over any hazardous obstacle . The car no longer releases these jacks to boost it for any repairs and adjustments . It is considered a standard racing gadget in the film . The jacks can be activated in pairs to perform various kinds of flips , and at specific intensities to control jump height . Control B = Bullet - proof polymer deflector ( D in the original , B activated the Grip Tires in the original ) When pressed , the car sprouts a bullet - and impact - proof shield that encloses the cockpit . Control C = Tire Shields ( C activated the rotary saws in the original , replaced Frogger Mode ) When pressed , the car sprouts shields from its tires to prevent tire damage from secret weapons of other racing competitors . Speed can control the motion of the shields by remote control inside the cockpit . Control D = Hexodyne emergency spare tires ( D activated the Deflector shield in the original , replaces Evening eye ) If a tire does get heavily damaged , this button causes it to regenerate . This function applies to any of the Mach 5 's four tires . Control E = Zircon - tipped cutter blades ( C in the original , E originally activated the special Evening Eye ) When pressed , the Mach Five releases two rotary saws from the front of the car that can cut through almost anything . The cutter blades can pivot around for more dynamic combat in racing . Control F = Tire crampon grips ( B in the original , F originally activated Frogger mode in the original ) When pressed , the Mach Five sprouts special spiked grip tires for traction over any kind of terrain ( firm , icy , unsteady ground , and significant slopes ) . Control G = Homing robot ( As in the original ) When pressed , the Mach Five releases a remote control robot bird capable of transmitting footage back to the Mach Five from wherever it is . This function was n't used in the film . In the 1959 movie `` On the Beach '' Dr Julian Osborne ( played by Fred Astaire ) races in a white number 5 Ferrari while wearing a white helmet and goggles -- eerily similar to Speed Racer in the Mach Five . Speed Racer : the next generation ( edit ) Main article : Speed Racer : The Next Generation In the animated 2008 series , which takes place about 40 years after the events in the original anime , the Mach Five only has a part in the second episode . The protagonists find it in pieces in a junkyard near the school they attend , and rebuild it . The second episode features the rebuilt Mach Five designed as it appeared in the original anime , the only difference 's is that it is animated in CGI like all of the cars in the show and the wheel rims are black while in the original show they were a silver white color . Minor changes have occurred in the Mach Five in this series . Although the function for the Homing Robot is present , the overall design of the actual robot has changed . In the original anime , the robot resembles a sleek , futuristic robot dove , while in this series , the robot resembles more of a metal peacock . The Deflector was used as the roof of the Mach Five . Also revealed in this show is an ejector 's seat underneath the driver 's seat in case of emergencies . A parachute was made , but was forgotten to be installed at the time . Its return is brief , as one of the antagonists destroys it successfully . However , plans for a new car are discovered and soon the protagonists build the Mach 6 . The Mach 6 's engine is not designed to run on gas , which is a crucial story point , even though gas is still used for it through most of the series . It has all the features of the Mach Five , but redesigned or changed in some form or another . For example , the rotary saws are kept , but they 're turned into laser saws , and the blades can pivot so things that are over head can be cut . The new car features a transparent , holographic screen over the dashboard that the driver can use to interact live with his crew , and with other racers . Functions are not activated by a steering wheel hub lettered A-G , but instead , by switches mounted around the steering wheel . The Mach 6 succeeded the Mach 5 as the main vehicle for the rest of the series . More of the original gadgets were gradually revealed ( such as the sludge slick ) and used in future episodes . Eventually , the Mach 5 returned as Speed Racer Sr. 's main car in the season 2 premiere . Mach Five in popular culture ( edit ) The Presidents of the United States of America released a car - themed song named `` Mach 5 '' in 1996 . Road & Track magazine released an article about a `` real '' Mach 5 prototype car on 31 March 2008 ( the day before April 1st ) , about a `` genuine running model '' made for the 2008 film . The article included performance data and feature descriptions for the car that was `` in a league by itself '' . `` New Future Weapon '' , a 2008 song by Billy Idol , mentions the titular object is `` faster than a Mach Five '' . In the video game Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 by Infinity Ward , you can wear a title in the multiplayer part of the game which displays a car wheel along with the title `` Mach 5 '' , unlocked after shooting an entire submachine gun magazine without missing . In the Dexter 's Laboratory episode `` Mock 5 '' which is a Speed Racer parody , Dexter , who portrays Speed , drives a car with a lot of the same characteristics called the Mach 5 . In the Shadow Warrior first person shooter video game , the main character Lo Wang plays with a remote - controlled Mach - 5 toy car to get a key . When playing , Lo Wang sings the Speed Racer theme . In the online typing game , Nitro Type , it is available as an achievement car for completing 30,000 races and is renamed the `` Wach 6 '' . It was created as a commemoration to the player CarriePirc . The Mach Five is featured in episode nine of the 2015 anime series , Yatterman Night , including its own interpretation of Chimchim named Sanpee . In Foster 's Home For Imaginary Friends , Mac fantasises about the `` Mach Schnell 5 '' , and while he does , the iconic image of Speed Racer alighting from the Mach 5 is recreated with Mac in for Speed , and the `` Mach Schnell 5 '' -- a smaller car , but , similar in appearance -- stands in for the Mach 5 . The Mach Five is featured in the 2018 movie Ready Player One ( film ) during a car racing scene .

Speed Racer at the wheel of his vehicle , The Mach Five The Mach Five ( マッハ 号 , Mahha - gō ) is the racing car Speed Racer ( Go Mifune in the Japanese version ) drives in the anime series of the same name ( known as `` Mach Go ! Go ! Go ! '' in Japan ) . The car was designed , built , and created by `` Pops Racer '' ( Daisuke Mifune ) , Speed Racer 's father . It features a set of special devices which Speed Racer uses throughout the series . In the original 1967 series , the Mach Five is a white racing car with an `` M '' written on its hood ( which does not stand for `` Mach 5 '' , but instead stands for `` Mifune '' , both Go 's last name , and the name of his father 's motor company ) . In the 1993 American remake , the design was completely changed . Its name probably derives from the fact that speeds above Mach 5 are known as hypersonic . However , the Mach Five can not reach Mach speeds . The name is also a pun in two languages : the word for `` five '' in Japanese is `` go '' . However , the `` go '' used for the car 's name is a suffix attached to the names of ships , etc . Thus , the car is known in the Japanese version as simply the `` Mach '' . Actual race cars that closely resemble the Mach Five are the 1966 Japanese Grand Prix - winning Prince R380 ( 1965 ) / Nissan R380 - II ( 1966 - 68 ) , the Le Mans - winners Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa ( designed by Scaglietti around 1958 through 1961 ) , the Aston Martin DBR1 ( Le Mans winner in 1959 ) , the Ford GT40 ( which was a very popular and successful racecar , mainly in Le Mans and other Touring series , in the 1960s ) , and the Chaparral 2C . Though perhaps most similar of all is the 1968 Ferrari 250 P5 , designed by Pininfarina .

Built on a 2001 Chevrolet Corvette Chassis , the body was to be extensively modified to look like the Mach Five . It was to have 345 horsepower , and cost between $75,000 and $125,000 each . The Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles , California has a mid-engine prototype of the Mach Fives in its collection . Portrayal in film Main article : Speed Racer ( film ) The Mach Five appears in the live - action film adaptation Speed Racer , directed by the Wachowski brothers , produced by Joel Silver , and released by Warner Bros. Pictures . The Mach Five is an actual vehicle and used in the major race of the film . Instead of being driven on pavement , it was hung from a crane and had its effects computer - generated . Along with the Mach Five , the movie features the `` Mach 4 '' and the `` Mach 6 '' , two different single - seater cars created specifically for stunt races . The designs of the Mach 4 and Mach 6 are vaguely reminiscent of the Mach Five 's ( as in the original American comics ) , although the only functions the Mach 6 features are the jump jacks , which are standard equipment in race cars in the movie . Little about the Mach 4 is known , as it appears only briefly in the film and is portrayed as a red - colored companion to the 6 . The film portrays the Mach Five as initially being a regular everyday vehicle , justifying the existence of its trunk door ( rather than having it serve solely as an excuse for Spritle and Chim - Chim to stow away in the vehicle ) . The Mach Five is later modified with gadgets and becomes Speed 's alternate car for off - track races such as the Casa Cristo 5000 , as well as everyday driving like a normal car . The Mach Five originally belonged to Speed 's older brother Rex , who relinquished ownership of it to Speed before he left the Racer home . Speed 's main car for races on the WRL track ( Thunderhead , etc . ) is the Mach 6 . The Mach 6 was destroyed in a fixed race , but was later rebuilt for the film 's final race . The steering wheel hub is still present on this version of the Mach Five . Although most of the original functions of the car are still intact , some are activated by different buttons . The underwater functions are abandoned completely and replaced with new functions exclusive to racing combat . Instead of being built with these features from the beginning , the special functions were added to the Mach Five in order to enter it in the Casa Cristo 5000 . The features that are still kept in this incarnation are : Auto Jacks Grip Tires ( Not as belt tires but as crampon tire spikes . ) Deflector Rotary Saws Homing Robot The functions abandoned in this version of the Mach Five are : Frogger Mode Evening Eye The functions on this Mach Five are : ( * ) New functions are represented with Bold Italics . Control A = Jump Jacks ( Originally called the Auto Jacks ) When pressed , the car releases and immediately retracts long automated car jacks that make the car jump over any hazardous obstacle . The car no longer releases these jacks to boost it for any repairs and adjustments . It is considered a standard racing gadget in the film . The jacks can be activated in pairs to perform various kinds of flips , and at specific intensities to control jump height . Control B = Bullet - proof polymer",

Button F was used for Frogger Mode (underwater mode). \n\nIn Speed Racer X, which is not to be confused with the 1993 Fred Wolf remake, these buttons had different names and functions:  \n- Button E became Emergency Wire (a rope and grappling hook function), which is completely different from the original Evening Eye.  \n- Button F became Fish Diver, functionally identical to Frogger Mode but involving a physical transformation of the car.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state the exact button functions in the 1993 remake by Fred Wolf, only distinguishing that Frogger Mode and Evening Eye were completely abandoned in that remake.\n\nTherefore, the buttons previously used for Frogger Mode and Evening Eye were not repurposed in the 1993 remake; instead, those features were completely abandoned. The repurposing described applies to Speed Racer X, not the 1993 remake.",

            "page_content": "or Special Illumination ( イブニング アイ , Ibuningu Ai , Evening Eye ) : The control for special illumination which can be traversed singly or in tandem , and which enables to see much farther and more clearly than with ordinary headlights . When used with the `` night shades '' attached to Speed 's helmet , his vision is enhanced with infrared light . Button E was later modified to activate mini-wings ( Pops got the idea from the Car Acrobatic Team ) that would slide out from under the car to assist Speed in long jumps . Button F , Frogger Mode ( フロッガー , Furoggā , Frogger ) : Used when the Mach Five is under water . First , the cockpit is supplied with oxygen . Then , a periscope is raised to scan the surface of the water . Everything that is seen is relayed down to the driver 's seat by television . The 100 - pound ( 45 kg ) auxiliary supply of oxygen is enough to last for thirty minutes . Button G , Go Homing Robot ( ギズモ 号 , Gizumo - gō , Gizmo ) : Releases a homing robot bird from the front of the car . The homing robot bird can fly and can carry pictures or tape recorded messages , handwritten messages , X-ray film , rope , and small Egyptian statues , and it has been used as a last resort as a makeshift weapon for means of defense . The bird - like device is operated by a built - in remote control within the cockpit . Button H , Homing Device ( ホーミング , Hōmingu , Homing ) : This button is , unlike the other buttons , not located on the steering wheel ; instead is located on a console between the seats . Button H is part of the Go Homing Robot 's controls , and it simply sends the robot `` home '' to a pre-programmed location , usually Speed 's house . The Mach Five also has a small trunk , which is unusual in a race car but was featured in many episodes , often as a hiding place for main characters Spritle ( Kurio Mifune ) and Chim - Chim ( Senpei ) . While the original manga features many of the above functions seen in the anime , and while there are buttons on the steering wheel , it does not `` codify '' the functions in any way , making the letter designations exclusive to the anime . Speed Racer X In Speed Racer X ( not to be confused with the 1993 Fred Wolf remake ) , the buttons had name changes , and sometimes function changes : Button A , Aero Jack ( エアロ ジャッキ , Earojakki ) : Similar to the Auto - Jacks , but uses compressed air and rocket thrusters to propel the car into the air , rather than actual metal jacks ( making `` Aero Jack '' a bit of a misnomer ) . Unlike the original series , this can only be used to make the car jump . This function actually appears in the original manga replacing the original Auto Jacks . Button B , Balloon Tire ( バルーン タイヤ , Barūn Taiya ) : Inflates the tires like balloons , giving them better traction ( similar to monster truck tires ) , as well as allowing the Mach 5 to float on water . Button C , Cutter Blade ( カッター ブレード , Kattā Burēdo ) : Instead of saws , this button activates laser `` blades '' to cut through obstacles . Button D , Defense Shield ( ディフェンス シールド , Difensu Shīrudo ) : Closes the cockpit in a bulletproof protective dome , like the original series . Button E , Emergency Wire ( エマージェンシー ワイヤー , Emājenshī Waiyā ) : Completely different from the original series , this shoots out a rope and grappling hook to snag objects , either to keep the Mach 5 from falling into dangerous situations , or to hoist itself out of them . Button F , Fish Diver ( フィッシュ ダイバー , Fisshu Daibā ) : Functionally identical to Frogger Mode , but causes a M.A.S.K. - like physical transformation in the car , the wheels folding in and maneuverability fins sprouting . Button G , The Gallant ( ギャラント 号 , Gyaranto - gō ) : Again , identical to the Gizmo Rocket , but with a new name . The new adventures of Speed Racer The steering wheel of the Mach Five in this series had eight unmarked rectangular buttons , arranged in two columns of four on either side of the steering wheel 's center .

Released as the fifth single from their fourth album All Hope Is Gone on September 28 , 2009 , the song charted at number two on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart , their highest - charted single to date , surpassing `` Dead Memories '' . It was not included in the All Hope Is Gone World Tour setlist but the band performed the song live at the October 11 , 2009 performance in Kennewick , Washington . Roadrunner Records placed `` Snuff '' at number 6 for its greatest music videos of all time . The song was also nominated for Best Single at the Kerrang ! Awards 2010 , but lost to `` Liquid Confidence '' by You Me at Six . It is the final single released from the band before the death of their bassist , Paul Gray who died just eight months after its release , and also the final single release before Joey Jordison left the band four years later . During recent solo acoustic shows , Corey Taylor has performed an acoustic version of `` Snuff '' as a tribute to Paul Gray . `` Snuff '' , `` Wait and Bleed '' , `` Left Behind '' , and `` Pulse of the Maggots '' were released as downloadable songs in the Rock Band series . Contents 1 Background 2 Music video 3 Chart positions 4 Track listing 5 Personnel 6 References Background ( edit ) `` This is the slow one . It 's another personal one . Again , not naming names , it 's about someone who helped me through a lot and I thought she felt the same way that I did and then she really let me down . At the same time , it was good that she did , because it was that final push to me figuring out myself . The lyrics are pretty self - explanatory . '' -- Corey Taylor `` Corey does n't really write music for Slipknot -- but , when he came over to hear the songs Paul ( Gray , bassist ) and I were working on for All Hope Is Gone , he showed me this ... I had him lay a scratch track down in the studio . Then I went in late at night , without telling him , and laid down some drums ... When he heard it the next day , he started crying . It 's Corey 's masterpiece . '' -- Joey Jordison Music video ( edit ) It was announced on October 14 , 2009 by Roadrunner Records that a music video fit within enough production quality to be considered a short film was to be released for `` Snuff '' , which premiered on December 18 , 2009 at 11 : 09 PM CST . It was co-directed by Shawn `` Clown '' Crahan and P.R. Brown , and features Malcolm McDowell and Ashley Laurence of Hellraiser fame . Corey Taylor is seen for the third time in a Slipknot video without his mask ( the other two times being : `` Dead Memories '' and `` Before I Forget '' ) and is cross-dressed at the end of the short film . The video is about a man ( played by Corey Taylor ) who has broken up with his girlfriend , but is truly obsessed with her . The man enters the woman 's apartment , smelling things with her scent on it . He then notices on the television a tape that he and the woman had made , and then collapses on to the woman 's bed . As she walks out the door , she does n't notice the man lying on her bed . The man then dives out after her , but she has already gone to visit a neighbor . Going back in , he sits at a table and holds a wine glass that she was drinking from . The glass shatters in his hands and the man goes into a rage , throwing things around and screaming . The video ends with the man cross dressed as his ex and exiting the corridor , revealing it was the man who had exited the apartment and not the woman ; the concierge , not seeing the difference , walks back along the corridor whistling the tune to the song .

    "document": "As a dog returns to his vomit , so a fool repeats his folly - wikipedia As a dog returns to his vomit , so a fool repeats his folly `` As a dog returns to his vomit , so a fool repeats his folly '' is an aphorism which appears in the Book of Proverbs in the Bible -- Proverbs 26 : 11 ( Hebrew : כְּ֭כֶלֶב שָׁ֣ב עַל ־ קֵאֹ֑ו כְּ֝סִ֗יל שֹׁונֶ֥ה בְאִוַּלְתֹּֽו ‎ Kəḵeleḇ šāḇ ' al - qê'ōw ; kəsîl , šōwneh ḇə'iwwaltōw . ) , also partially quoted in the New Testament , 2 Peter 2 : 22 . It means that fools are stubbornly inflexible and this is illustrated with the repulsive simile of the dog that eats its vomit again , even though this may be poisonous . Dogs were considered unclean in Biblical times as they were commonly scavengers of the dead and they appear in the Bible as repugnant creatures , symbolising evil . The reference to vomit indicates excessive indulgence and so also symbolises revulsion . The incorrigible nature of fools is further emphasised in Proverbs 27 : 22 , `` Though you grind a fool in a mortar , grinding them like grain with a pestle , you will not remove their folly from them . '' In Proverbs , the `` fool '' represents a person lacking moral behavior or discipline , and the `` wise '' represents someone who behaves carefully and righteously . The modern association of these words with intellectual capacity is not in the original context . Contents 1 Development 2 Usage 3 See also 4 References Development ( edit ) The Greek translation in the Septuagint developed the idea , imbuing it with a sense of shame and guilt , `` As when a dog goes to his own vomit and becomes abominable , so is a fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin . '' This was due to the contemporary idea of the fool as ungodly . Usage ( edit ) The Second Epistle of Peter refers to the proverb ( 2 Peter 2 : 22 ) , `` But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb , The dog is turned to his own vomit again ; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire . '' Kipling cites this in his poem The Gods of the Copybook Headings as one of several classic examples of repeated folly : `` As it will be in the future , it was at the birth of Man There are only four things certain since Social Progress began . That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire , And the burnt Fool 's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire ; '' The proverb is a favourite of the British politician Ken Livingstone who used it on the occasion of his failure to rejoin the Labour Party in 2002 . It was also used on occasion in the Parliament of Australia by Paul Keating , in reference to his political opponents . In the TV programme Endeavour ( the prequel to Inspector Morse ) , in the episode titled `` Home , '' Endeavour returns to his family home to visit his sick father . He goes with his sister Joyce to a pub for a drink and the following is part of their conversation : Joyce : `` Why did you go back to Oxford ? '' Endeavour : `` Oh ! A policeman goes where he 's sent . '' Joyce : `` When I told Pop , he just said , ' Proverbs 26 : 11 . ' '' Endeavour : ( Recognizing the verse ) `` Well I 've many faults , God knows , but I try to draw the line at masochism . Besides , traditionally it 's the killer that returns to the scene of the crime , not the ... whatever I was .

        "rag_answer": "The proverb \"As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly\" means that fools are stubbornly inflexible and tend to repeat their mistakes or wrong behaviors despite the negative consequences. It illustrates the incorrigible nature of fools by comparing them to a dog that eats its own vomit again, an act seen as repulsive and harmful. In the biblical context, a \"fool\" is a person lacking moral behavior or discipline, and unlike the modern association with intellectual capacity, it emphasizes moral folly. The proverb highlights the idea that fools persist in their foolishness or sin, showing a resistance to learning or change.",

            "page_content": "As a dog returns to his vomit , so a fool repeats his folly - wikipedia As a dog returns to his vomit , so a fool repeats his folly `` As a dog returns to his vomit , so a fool repeats his folly '' is an aphorism which appears in the Book of Proverbs in the Bible -- Proverbs 26 : 11 ( Hebrew : כְּ֭כֶלֶב שָׁ֣ב עַל ־ קֵאֹ֑ו כְּ֝סִ֗יל שֹׁונֶ֥ה בְאִוַּלְתֹּֽו ‎ Kəḵeleḇ šāḇ ' al - qê'ōw ; kəsîl , šōwneh ḇə'iwwaltōw . ) , also partially quoted in the New Testament , 2 Peter 2 : 22 . It means that fools are stubbornly inflexible and this is illustrated with the repulsive simile of the dog that eats its vomit again , even though this may be poisonous . Dogs were considered unclean in Biblical times as they were commonly scavengers of the dead and they appear in the Bible as repugnant creatures , symbolising evil . The reference to vomit indicates excessive indulgence and so also symbolises revulsion . The incorrigible nature of fools is further emphasised in Proverbs 27 : 22 , `` Though you grind a fool in a mortar , grinding them like grain with a pestle , you will not remove their folly from them . '' In Proverbs , the `` fool '' represents a person lacking moral behavior or discipline , and the `` wise '' represents someone who behaves carefully and righteously . The modern association of these words with intellectual capacity is not in the original context . Contents 1 Development 2 Usage 3 See also 4 References Development The Greek translation in the Septuagint developed the idea , imbuing it with a sense of shame and guilt , `` As when a dog goes to his own vomit and becomes abominable , so is a fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin . '' This was due to the contemporary idea of the fool as ungodly . Usage The Second Epistle of Peter refers to the proverb ( 2 Peter 2 : 22 ) , `` But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb , The dog is turned to his own vomit again ; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire . '' Kipling cites this in his poem The Gods of the Copybook Headings as one of several classic examples of repeated folly : `` As it will be in the future , it was at the birth of Man There are only four things certain since Social Progress began . That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire , And the burnt Fool 's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire ; '' The proverb is a favourite of the British politician Ken Livingstone who used it on the occasion of his failure to rejoin the Labour Party in 2002 . It was also used on occasion in the Parliament of Australia by Paul Keating , in reference to his political opponents . In the TV programme Endeavour ( the prequel to Inspector Morse ) , in the episode titled `` Home , '' Endeavour returns to his family home to visit his sick father . He goes with his sister Joyce to a pub for a drink and the following is part of their conversation : Joyce : `` Why did you go back to Oxford ? '' Endeavour : `` Oh ! A policeman goes where he 's sent . '' Joyce : `` When I told Pop , he just said , ' Proverbs 26 : 11 . ' '' Endeavour : ( Recognizing the verse ) `` Well I 've many faults , God knows , but I try to draw the line at masochism . Besides , traditionally it 's the killer that returns to the scene of the crime , not the ... whatever I was . '' See also Digger wasps and their habit of sphexishness References Jump up ^ Bruce K.

In 2015 , to help support her husband in his political career , she ended her career as a teacher of literature at the elite lycée Saint - Louis de Gonzague in Paris . Contents ( hide ) 1 Early life and education 2 Career 3 Politics 4 Personal life 5 References 6 External links Early life and education ( edit ) Jean Trogneux shop , Saint - Quentin , 2012 Brigitte Macron was born Brigitte Marie - Claude Trogneux in Amiens , France . Her parents were Simone ( née Pujol ; 1910 -- 1998 ) and Jean Trogneux ( 1909 -- 1994 ) , the owners of the five - generation Chocolaterie Trogneux , founded in 1872 in Amiens . The company , now known as Jean Trogneux , is run by her nephew , Jean - Alexandre Trogneux . She was the youngest of her parents ' six children . Career ( edit ) Brigitte Auzière taught literature at the Collège Lucie - Berger in Strasbourg in the 1980s . By the 1990s , she taught French and Latin at Lycée la Providence , a Jesuit high school in Amiens . It was at that high school that she and Emmanuel Macron first met . He attended her literature classes and she was in charge of the theater class he attended . Their romance was not typical as she was his senior by 24 years and 8 months , and Macron has described it as `` a love often clandestine , often hidden , misunderstood by many before imposing itself '' . Politics ( edit ) Brigitte Auzière ran for the city council of Truchtersheim in 1989 , but lost . It would be the only time she would run for office . In 2017 , Brigitte Macron played an active role in her husband 's presidential campaign ; a top adviser was quoted as saying that `` her presence is essential for him '' . Emmanuel Macron stated that upon his winning of the French presidency , his wife `` will have the role that she always had with me , she will not be hidden '' . Following a petition against a proposed change in her status that gathered more than 275,000 signatures , the French government announced that Brigitte Macron will not be holding the official title of `` First Lady '' , and will not be allocated an official budget for her activities . In an interview with French magazine Elle , she stated that a soon - to - be published transparency charter would clarify her `` role and accompanying resources '' , including the composition and size of her staff . Personal life ( edit ) On 22 June 1974 , she married the banker André - Louis Auzière , with whom she had three children : Sébastien Auzière ( born 1975 ) , an engineer , Dr Laurence Auzière - Jourdan ( born in 1977 ) , a cardiologist and Tiphaine Auzière ( born in 1984 ) , a lawyer . They resided in Truchtersheim until 1991 , when they moved to Amiens . She divorced Auzière in 2006 and married Macron in 2007 . In August 2017 , the Presidential couple announced their adoption of a pet dog that they named Nemo .

    "document": "Glumdalclitch - wikipedia Glumdalclitch Jump to : navigation , search This article is written like a personal reflection or opinion essay that states a Wikipedia editor 's personal feelings about a topic . Please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style . ( October 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Gulliver and Glumdalclitch , from a French edition of Gulliver 's Travels ( 1850s ) Glumdalclitch is the name Gulliver gives his `` nurse '' in Book II of Jonathan Swift 's Gulliver 's Travels . In Book I , Gulliver travels to the land of Lilliput . Leaving there , he travels to the land of Brobdingnag . In Lilliput , Gulliver was a giant , and in Brobdingnag , he is a dwarf , with the proportions reversed . When he comes ashore , he is captured by a giant farmer , who perceives Gulliver only as an animal , a freak of nature resembling a man - shaped mouse . He takes Gulliver home and gives him to his nine - year - old daughter , a child `` not above forty feet high , being little for her age . '' She makes Gulliver her pet , creates a small travel case for him ( a miniature bed - chamber in a box ) , and is amused to play with him as if he were a doll . Gulliver grows very fond of the girl , and gives her the pet name of Glumdalclitch , or `` little nurse '' in the Brobdingian language . ( Of course `` little '' is highly ironic considering the circumstances . If Gulliver knows her real name , he does not tell the reader . ) Glumdalclitch is a skilled seamstress with a talent for making dolls ' clothes . Although Gulliver admires the wardrobe that she makes for him , he finds that even the finest Brodingnagian fabric is coarse and irritates his skin . The farmer takes Gulliver about as a freak show , charging observers money for performances . Gulliver grows very proud of the stunts that he performs for Glumdalclitch 's amusement . When the Queen of Brobdingnag takes Gulliver into her court , he has Glumdalclitch brought to court with him . The prideful Gulliver thinks of himself as being greatly honored and promoted by moving to court , but never ceases to love and seek the approval of the little girl who first helped him . Indeed , he remembers her fondly even after returning to England . While Book I is narrowly allegorical , Book II of Gulliver 's Travels is less specifically a roman a clef and more generally a political and philosophical discussion . While Glumdalclitch could represent Swift 's memories of the young Stella from his time living with William Temple at Moor Park , Surrey , she probably does not stand in for any particularly identifiable historical person . If one does take Glumdalclitch as the young Stella and the entire episode as an encoding of the time at Moor Park , then it is a poignant story indeed . Swift , like Gulliver , delighted in performing for Stella ( e.g. his Meditation Upon a Broomstick , which he wrote for her ) , was shown about by her `` father '' ( William Temple ) , found the living too coarse for his sensibilities , left her company for a `` promotion '' to London and court life , and mourned her absence for the rest of his life . In popular culture ( edit ) In television and film adaptations , the character has been played by Sherry Alberoni , Ági Szirtes , and Kate Maberly , and voiced by Janet Waldo . The character was reimagined in the 2010 film adaptation ( in a non-speaking role ) as a child and treats Gulliver as a baby doll , presumably to keep with the comedy themes . It was a family nickname for the novelist Jane Octavia Brookfield . Glumdalclitch is the subject of an eponymous novel by Leo Sonderegger published in 2000 as a sequel to Gulliver 's Travels .

Initially , Pike Place Fish Market was unknown outside of the Seattle area , but Yokoyama and his staff decided to change that in a meeting with a business coach in 1986 . Prior to the meeting , the Pike Place Fish Market was near to bankruptcy , and the consultant , Jim Bergquist , was helping them to conceive of ways to save the business . A fish market employee at the meeting suggested that they not only save the business , but make it `` world famous '' , with the ideas for the business ' flying and thrown fish , games with customers , and staff attitudes of always enjoying their work , so that customers would as well . In an interview , Yokoyama stated , `` We took a stand that we were going to become world famous . We just said it and it became so .

Flying fish ( edit ) A flying salmon The Pike Place Fish Market is best known for their habit of hurling customers ' orders across the shopping area . A typical routine will involve a customer ordering a fish , with their fishmongers in orange rubber overalls and boots calling out the order , which is loudly shouted back by all the other staff , at which point the original fishmonger will throw the customer 's fish behind the counter for wrapping . Initially , the shouted repeating of the ordered fish began as a prank on one employee , but was enjoyed by customers , so it became a tradition . While working , the staff continually yell to each other and chant in unison while they throw ordered fish . At times , the fish market staff will throw a foam fish into the crowd to scare bystanders , or select a customer from the crowds to participate in the fish toss . Above the areas in which they throw fish , the market hangs a sign that reads , `` Caution : Low Flying Fish '' .

( November 2010 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Located on the site of a Winnebago Indian village , Charles City was originally named `` Charlestown '' for the son of the first - known white settler to the area , Joseph Kelly . Upon his 1851 arrival to the area , Kelly envisioned the site , with its ample supply of water from the Cedar River and adjacent timberlands , as an ideal location for a town . By 1852 , twenty - five other settler families had joined Kelly in that vision and a community was born . The town name changed , first to `` St. Charles '' and then to `` Charles City , '' to avoid duplication of other Iowa town names . Charles City became the county seat after Floyd County was established in 1851 and officially organized in 1854 . Floyd County itself was named for Sergeant Charles Floyd of the Lewis and Clark Expedition . Hart - Parr Charles City nameplate on an early tractor Hart - Parr 30 - 60 `` Old Reliable '' Charles City is known for the role it played in the history of the American tractor . A native son Charles Walter Hart , whose father owned three local farms , met Charles H. Parr in college . After graduating from the University of Wisconsin , Hart and Parr developed a two - cylinder gasoline engine and set up their Hart - Parr Gasoline Engine Company in Charles City in 1897 . It was here in 1901 the term `` tractor '' with Latin roots and a combination of the words traction and power was first coined by Hart and Parr . In 1903 the firm built fifteen `` tractors '' , the first successful production - model tractor line in the U.S. The 14,000 pound No. 3 is the oldest surviving internal combustion engine tractor in the United States and is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington D.C. In 1929 , Hart - Parr was one of the four companies that merged to form Oliver Farm Equipment Company and finally the White Farm - New Idea Equipment Co . At its peak in the mid-1970s , the sprawling plant complex encompassed 23 acres and employed nearly 3,000 workers . The 1980s farm crisis and other economic pressures led to the closing of the plant in 1993 . As of 2013 , the vacant site stands ready for re-use . HART - PARR washing machine Although more famously known for producing tractors , the Hart - Parr company also made some of the first washing machines . Selling for $155.00 in the 1920s , the buyer had the option of ordering either an electric or gasoline engine The Floyd County Historical Museum preserves the plant 's history and memories in an extensive collection of documents and artifacts . Charles City is the location of the last lynching in Iowa , that of James Cullen in 1907 . National women 's rights leader Carrie Lane Chapman Catt spent her girlhood years on a farm south of Charles City . Catt is well known as a prominent leader of the woman 's suffrage movement and her efforts in helping to pass the 19th Amendment ratified on August 18 , 1920 , granting women the right to vote . Carrie Catt was also the founder of the League of Women Voters . Her home and a visitor 's center are open for public viewing . On June 9 , 2008 , record flooding caused major damage in the town . Charles City 's historic suspension bridge , which crossed over the Cedar River , collapsed as well as destroyed numerous homes around the city . The City of Charles City has since received FEMA and state funding for a brand new bridge in place of the old suspension bridge . A new bridge opened in early 2010 . Charles City is the location of the Dr. Alvin L. Miller House , a Usonian home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright .

In June 1908 ( possibly June 7 ) a tornado destroyed or substantially damaged around 200 homes and barns . Residents W.R. Beck and a child were killed . The path of the tornado ran through the southeast part of the city missing the business district .

( November 2010 ) Located on the site of a Winnebago Indian village , Charles City was originally named `` Charlestown '' for the son of the first - known white settler to the area , Joseph Kelly . Upon his 1851 arrival to the area , Kelly envisioned the site , with its ample supply of water from the Cedar River and adjacent timberlands , as an ideal location for a town . By 1852 , twenty - five other settler families had joined Kelly in that vision and a community was born . The town name changed , first to `` St. Charles '' and then to `` Charles City , '' to avoid duplication of other Iowa town names . Charles City became the county seat after Floyd County was established in 1851 and officially organized in 1854 . Floyd County itself was named for Sergeant Charles Floyd of the Lewis and Clark Expedition . Hart - Parr Charles City nameplate on an early tractor Hart - Parr 30 - 60 `` Old Reliable '' Charles City is known for the role it played in the history of the American tractor . A native son Charles Walter Hart , whose father owned three local farms , met Charles H. Parr in college . After graduating from the University of Wisconsin , Hart and Parr developed a two - cylinder gasoline engine and set up their Hart - Parr Gasoline Engine Company in Charles City in 1897 . It was here in 1901 the term `` tractor '' with Latin roots and a combination of the words traction and power was first coined by Hart and Parr . In 1903 the firm built fifteen `` tractors '' , the first successful production - model tractor line in the U.S. The 14,000 pound No. 3 is the oldest surviving internal combustion engine tractor in the United States and is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington D.C. In 1929 , Hart - Parr was one of the four companies that merged to form Oliver Farm Equipment Company and finally the White Farm - New Idea Equipment Co . At its peak in the mid-1970s , the sprawling plant complex encompassed 23 acres and employed nearly 3,000 workers . The 1980s farm crisis and other economic pressures led to the closing of the plant in 1993 . As of 2013 , the vacant site stands ready for re-use . HART - PARR washing machine",

    "document": "All - way stop - wikipedia All - way stop Jump to : navigation , search This article is missing information about the history of the subject . Please expand the article to include this information . Further details may exist on the talk page . ( September 2011 ) A 4 - way stop An all - way stop ( or four - way stop when there are four approaches to the intersection ) is an intersection system used predominantly in the United States of America and Canada where traffic approaching it from all directions is required to stop before proceeding through the intersection . An all - way stop may have multiple approaches and may be marked with a supplemental plate stating the number of approaches . Contents ( hide ) 1 Operation 2 Application 3 Benefits and disadvantages 4 Worldwide comparisons 5 See also 6 References Operation ( edit ) A motorist approaching an all - way stop is always required to come to a full stop before the crosswalk or stop line . In most jurisdictions that use all - way stops , pedestrians always have priority at a crosswalk , even if the crosswalk is not delineated with pavement markings . Within some U.S. jurisdictions , such as the state of Idaho , bicyclists are exempt from the need to make a complete stop , but must give way to other vehicles as otherwise required by law . After a full - stop has been made , vehicles usually have the right - of - way to proceed through the intersection in the order that they arrived at the intersection . In the United States , if vehicles arrive at approximately the same time , each driver must yield to the drivers on their right . Some areas have additional formal and informal rules which may or may not include special procedures for when all stop signs are approached simultaneously . Application ( edit ) All roads leading into an all - way stop have an octagonal `` stop '' sign In the United States , the Federal Highway Administration 's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices ( MUTCD ) defines the standards commonly used for the application of all - way stops . Where a stop has been determined to qualify , it is signed at all approaches to the intersections with a standard octagonal `` Stop '' sign , with a supplemental `` ALL WAY '' plaque . Earlier editions of the MUTCD allowed supplemental plaques specifying the number of approaches in an all - way stop , as in `` 3 WAY '' or `` 4 WAY '' . According to the MUTCD , installation of an all - way stop should be based on a traffic engineering study to determine if minimum traffic volume or safety criteria are met . These intersections are often found where roads with considerably equal traffic levels meet each other but the overall level of traffic present at the intersection does not justify a traffic light , and or in a location where the right of way was otherwise unclear . An all - way stop may also be justified if the intersection has a demonstrated history of crashes in a given period of a type susceptible to correction by installing an all - way stop . All - way stops may also be used as an interim measure preceding the placement of a traffic light , to provide a low - speed area for pedestrians to cross , where a cross street experiences considerable difficulty finding safe gaps due to heavy traffic volumes , or where traffic is frequently delayed by turning conflicts . Additionally , the MUTCD advocates the placement of all - way stops at intersections between through roads in residential areas if an engineering study can show that traffic flow would be improved by installing the all - way stop control . Despite published guidelines , all - way stops are routinely placed by jurisdictions due to political pressure from adjacent residents . Intersections between two minor highways with similar traffic counts , two collector roads in an urban or suburban setting or a collector road and a local road in a busy setting ( such as near a school ) are the most common locations for an all - way stop . Traffic signals will sometimes flash red indications in all directions following a malfunction , or all - red flashing operation may be scheduled to reduce delay or handle construction activity or unusual traffic patterns . When a traffic signal flashes in all - red mode , it legally operates as an all - way stop . When all approaches to an intersection are controlled in this way the rules for an all - way stop apply . However , it must also be noted that traffic signals may also flash yellow to major directions and flash red to minor directions during off - peak times to minimize traffic delays , in which case only side - street traffic is required to stop and yield the right of way to crossing traffic on the major street . During electrical outages when a traffic signal does not display any indications including flashing red , some jurisdictions require that the intersection be treated as an all - way stop . Other jurisdictions treat a dark signal as an uncontrolled intersection , where standard rules of right - of - way apply without the requirement of a complete stop . Benefits and disadvantages ( edit ) The main reason for the use of stop signs at road junctions is safety . According to an international study of locations where the system is in use , all - way stop control applied to four - legged intersections may reduce accident occurrence by 45 % . However , given alternative methods of intersection control and some of the disadvantages of all - way stops , the Handbook of Road Safety Measures recommends that four - way stops are best used between minor roads away from urbanized areas . Another benefit of all - way stops is assurance that vehicles enter the intersection at a low speed and have more time to take heed of the traffic situation , especially useful when sight distance is highly restricted . Some of the disadvantages associated with all - way stops are : Increased emissions of hydrocarbons . Increased average delay . Discouraging bicycling . That once installed , stop signs in general are unsafe to remove , accidents that result in injury may increase by 40 % . Once an all - way stop is installed , removal is difficult and risky , as habitual drivers may continue to expect an all - way stop condition . Worldwide comparisons ( edit ) Few countries outside North America -- least of all , those in Europe -- have intersections at which all users must stop at all times ; the conditions for stop sign placement may indeed preclude such an arrangement in many places . In Sweden all - way stops ( Flervägsstopp ) have been tested since the 1980s but are little used even though they are now permitted . In the UK they have always been very uncommon and were formally prohibited by the Department for Transport in 2002 . At four - legged intersections within Europe , a roundabout or mini-roundabout is commonly used to assign a relative priority to each approach . ( Roundabouts remain rare in North America , where early failures of rotaries and traffic circles caused such designs to lose favor until the gradual introduction of the modern roundabout in the late 20th century . ) Alternatively , at smaller intersections , priority to the right is widely used in most countries with right - hand traffic .

An all-way stop may have multiple approaches and may be marked with a supplemental plate stating the number of approaches.",

        "rag_answer": "An all-way stop is an intersection system used predominantly in the United States and Canada where traffic approaching from all directions is required to come to a full stop before proceeding through the intersection. It is typically marked with standard octagonal \"Stop\" signs and a supplemental plaque stating \"ALL WAY\" or indicating the number of approaches. Vehicles proceed through the intersection in the order that they arrive, and if vehicles arrive simultaneously, each driver yields to the driver on their right. All-way stops are often installed where roads with approximately equal traffic levels meet but the traffic volume does not justify a traffic light, or where the right of way is otherwise unclear.",

( September 2011 ) A 4 - way stop An all - way stop ( or four - way stop when there are four approaches to the intersection ) is an intersection system used predominantly in the United States of America and Canada where traffic approaching it from all directions is required to stop before proceeding through the intersection .

In most jurisdictions that use all - way stops , pedestrians always have priority at a crosswalk , even if the crosswalk is not delineated with pavement markings . Within some U.S. jurisdictions , such as the state of Idaho , bicyclists are exempt from the need to make a complete stop , but must give way to other vehicles as otherwise required by law . After a full - stop has been made , vehicles usually have the right - of - way to proceed through the intersection in the order that they arrived at the intersection . In the United States , if vehicles arrive at approximately the same time , each driver must yield to the drivers on their right . Some areas have additional formal and informal rules which may or may not include special procedures for when all stop signs are approached simultaneously . Application All roads leading into an all - way stop have an octagonal `` stop '' sign In the United States , the Federal Highway Administration 's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices ( MUTCD ) defines the standards commonly used for the application of all - way stops . Where a stop has been determined to qualify , it is signed at all approaches to the intersections with a standard octagonal `` Stop '' sign , with a supplemental `` ALL WAY '' plaque . Earlier editions of the MUTCD allowed supplemental plaques specifying the number of approaches in an all - way stop , as in `` 3 WAY '' or `` 4 WAY '' . According to the MUTCD , installation of an all - way stop should be based on a traffic engineering study to determine if minimum traffic volume or safety criteria are met . These intersections are often found where roads with considerably equal traffic levels meet each other but the overall level of traffic present at the intersection does not justify a traffic light , and or in a location where the right of way was otherwise unclear . An all - way stop may also be justified if the intersection has a demonstrated history of crashes in a given period of a type susceptible to correction by installing an all - way stop . All - way stops may also be used as an interim measure preceding the placement of a traffic light , to provide a low - speed area for pedestrians to cross , where a cross street experiences considerable difficulty finding safe gaps due to heavy traffic volumes , or where traffic is frequently delayed by turning conflicts . Additionally , the MUTCD advocates the placement of all - way stops at intersections between through roads in residential areas if an engineering study can show that traffic flow would be improved by installing the all - way stop control . Despite published guidelines , all - way stops are routinely placed by jurisdictions due to political pressure from adjacent residents . Intersections between two minor highways with similar traffic counts , two collector roads in an urban or suburban setting or a collector road and a local road in a busy setting ( such as near a school ) are the most common locations for an all - way stop .

According to the guidelines referenced in the context, their installation should be based on a traffic engineering study to determine if minimum traffic volume or safety criteria are met. They are often used where roads with similar traffic levels intersect but the overall traffic volume does not justify a traffic light. They may also be justified where there is a history of crashes that could be reduced by an all-way stop, or as an interim measure before installing traffic lights. Additionally, they can improve traffic flow in residential areas under certain conditions. However, despite these guidelines, all-way stops are sometimes installed due to political pressure rather than strictly meeting the criteria. Therefore, all-way stops are best used in specific scenarios where they effectively enhance safety or traffic management.",

The introduction of a tax drives a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product , which typically imposes an economic burden on both producers and consumers . The concept was brought to attention by the French Physiocrats , in particular François Quesnay , who argued that the incidence of all taxation falls ultimately on landowners and is at the expense of land rent . Tax incidence is said to `` fall '' upon the group that ultimately bears the burden of , or ultimately has to pay , the tax . The key concept is that the tax incidence or tax burden does not depend on where the revenue is collected , but on the price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply . The theory of tax incidence has a number of practical results . For example , United States Social Security payroll taxes are paid half by the employee and half by the employer . However , some economists think that the worker bears almost the entire burden of the tax because the employer passes the tax on in the form of lower wages . The tax incidence is thus said to fall on the employee . However , it could equally well be argued that in some cases the incidence of the tax falls on the employer . This is because both the price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply affect on whom the incidence of the tax falls . Price controls such as the minimum wage which sets a price floor and market distortions such as subsidies or welfare payments also complicate the analysis . Contents ( hide ) 1 Example of tax incidence 2 Graphical analysis 2.1 Inelastic supply , elastic demand 2.2 Elastic supply , inelastic demand 2.3 Similarly elastic supply and demand 3 Macroeconomic perspective 3.1 Other considerations of tax burden 3.2 Tax burden of a country relative to GDP 3.3 Clarification 4 Other practical results 5 Assessment 6 See also 7 Notes Example of tax incidence ( edit ) Imagine a $1 tax on every barrel of apples an apple farmer produces . If the product ( apples ) is price inelastic to the consumer the farmer is able to pass the entire tax on to consumers of apples by raising the price by $1 . In this example , consumers bear the entire burden of the tax ; the tax incidence falls on consumers . On the other hand , if the apple farmer is unable to raise prices because the product is price elastic the farmer has to bear the burden of the tax or face decreased revenues : the tax incidence falls on the farmer . If the apple farmer can raise prices by an amount less than $1 , then consumers and the farmer are sharing the tax burden . When the tax incidence falls on the farmer , this burden will typically flow back to owners of the relevant factors of production , including agricultural land and employee wages . Where the tax incidence falls depends ( in the short run ) on the price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply . Tax incidence falls mostly upon the group that responds least to price ( the group that has the most inelastic price - quantity curve ) . If the demand curve is inelastic relative to the supply curve the tax will be disproportionately borne by the buyer rather than the seller . If the demand curve is elastic relative to the supply curve , the tax will be born disproportionately by the seller . If PED = PES the tax burden is split equally between buyer and seller . Tax incidence can be calculated using the pass - through fraction . The pass - through fraction for buyers is PES / ( PES - PED ) . So if PED for apples is - 0.4 and PES is 0.5 then the pass - through fraction to buyer would be calculated as follows : PES / ( PES - PED ) = 0.5 / ( 0.5 - ( -. 0.4 ) ) = 0.5 / 0.9 = 56 % . 56 % of any tax increase would be `` paid '' by the buyer ; 44 % would be `` paid '' by the seller . From the perspective of the seller , the formula is - PED / ( PES - PED ) = - ( - 0.4 ) / ( 0.5 - ( - 0.4 ) ) = 0.4 ∕. 9 = 44 % Graphical analysis ( edit ) For a primer on reading supply and demand graphs , see Supply and demand . For a primer on the economic effects of a tax , see Tax . Inelastic supply , elastic demand ( edit ) Because the producer is perfectly inelastic , they will produce the same quantity no matter the price . Because the consumer is elastic , the consumer is very sensitive to price . A small increase in price leads to a large drop in the quantity demanded . The imposition of the tax causes the market price to increase from P without tax to P with tax and the quantity demanded to fall from Q without tax to Q with tax . Because the consumer is elastic , the quantity change is significant . Because the producer is inelastic , the price does n't change much . The producer is unable to pass the tax onto the consumer and the tax incidence falls on the producer . In this example , the tax is collected from the producer and the producer bears the tax burden . This is known as back shifting . Tax incidence or burden does not in any way depend on where the revenue has been collected . It rather depends on the price elasticity of demand as well as the price elasticity of the supply . Tax burden as seen refers to the people who pay the taxes whether producer or consumer and considers the societal effects that result . It is said to fall entirely on the group that bears the burden or who has to pay the tax . Elastic supply , inelastic demand ( edit ) If , in contrast to the previous example , the producer is perfectly inelastic , he will continue producing the same quantity no matter the price . In case that the consumer is elastic ; the consumer becomes very sensitive and weary of the price ( Melville 24 ) . A small increase in the price of something leads to a large drop in the quantity that is being demanded . The imposition of taxes causes the market price to have an increase from P without taxes . It rises to P with taxes . In most markets , elasticities of the supply and demand are similar to the short - run and result in the burden of the taxes that has been imposed . The tax that has been imposed is shared between two groups and in varying proportions . In general , the group that will have a greater tax burden is the one that exhibits greater relative inelasticity ( Prasad 49 ) . When there is an increase in elasticity in one place , the demand for the quantity changes so that it can suit the different needs that have been set by the tax burden . Tax burden , therefore , varies a lot with elasticity in materials . Similarly elastic supply and demand ( edit ) Most markets fall between these two extremes , and ultimately the incidence of tax is shared between producers and consumers in varying proportions . In this example , the consumers pay more than the producers , but not all of the tax . The area paid by consumers is obvious as the change in equilibrium price ( between P without tax and P with tax ) ; the remainder , being the difference between the new price and the cost of production at that quantity , is paid by the producers . Inelastic supply , elastic demand : the burden is on producers Similar elasticities : burden shared Macroeconomic perspective ( edit ) The supply and demand for a good is deeply intertwined with the markets for the factors of production and for alternate goods and services that might be produced or consumed . Although legislators might be seeking to tax the apple industry , in reality it could turn out to be truck drivers who are hardest hit , if apple companies shift toward shipping by rail in response to their new cost . Or perhaps orange manufacturers will be the group most affected , if consumers decide to forgo oranges to maintain their previous level of apples at the now higher price . Ultimately , the burden of the tax falls on people -- the owners , customers , or workers . However , the true burden of the tax can not be properly assessed without knowing the use of the tax revenues . If the tax proceeds are employed in a manner that benefits owners more than producers and consumers then the burden of the tax will fall on producers and consumers . If the proceeds of the tax are used in a way that benefits producers and consumers , then owners suffer the tax burden . These are class distinctions concerning the distribution of costs and are not addressed in current tax incidence models . The US military offers major benefit to owners who produce offshore . Yet the tax levy to support this effort falls primarily on American producers and consumers . Corporations simply move out of the tax jurisdiction but still receive the property rights enforcement that is the mainstay of their income . Other considerations of tax burden ( edit ) Consider a 7 % import tax applied equally to all imports ( oil , autos , hula hoops , and brake rotors ; steel , grain , everything ) and a direct refund of every penny of collected revenue in the form of a direct egalitarian `` Citizen 's Dividend '' to every person who files Income Tax returns . At the macro level ( aggregate ) the people as a whole will break even . But the people who consume foreign produced goods will bear more of the burden than the people who consume a mix of goods . The people who consume no foreign goods will bear none of the burden and actually receive an increase in utility . On the producer side , the tax burden distribution will depend on whether a firm produces its goods within the sovereignty or outside the sovereignty . Firms that produce goods inside the sovereignty will increase their market share and their profits when compared to firms who offshore their production . And if the current mix of firms is tilted toward offshore production then the owners of firms will be burdened more than the consumers while the workers / employees will benefit from greater employment opportunities . Tax burden of a country relative to GDP ( edit ) A country or state 's tax burden as a percentage of GDP is the ratio of tax collection against the national gross domestic product ( GDP ) . This is one way of illustrating how high and broad the tax base is in any particular place . Some countries , like Sweden , have a high tax - to - GDP ratio ( as high as 54 % ) . Other countries , like India , have a low ratio . Some states increase the tax - to - GDP ratio by a certain percentage in order to cover deficiencies in the state budget revenue . In states where the tax revenue has gone up significantly , the percentage of tax revenue that is applied towards state revenue and foreign debt is sometimes higher . When tax revenues grow at a slower rate than the GDP of a country , the tax - to - GDP ratio drops . Taxes paid by individuals and corporations often account for the majority of tax receipts , especially in developed countries . Clarification ( edit ) The burden from taxation is not just the quantity of tax paid ( directly or indirectly ) , but the magnitude of the lost consumer surplus or producer surplus . The concepts are related but different . For example , imposing a $1000 per gallon of milk tax will raise no revenue ( because legal milk production will stop ) , but this tax will cause substantial economic harm ( lost consumer surplus and lost producer surplus ) . When examining tax incidence , it is the lost consumer and producer surplus that is important . See the tax article for more discussion . Other practical results ( edit ) The theory of tax incidence has a large number of practical results , although economists dispute the magnitude and significance of these results : If the government requires employers to provide employees with health care , some of the burden will fall on the employee as the employer will pass it on in the form of lower wages . Some of the burden will be borne by employer ( and ultimately the customer in form of higher prices or lower quality ) since both the supply of and demand for labor are highly inelastic and have few perfect substitutes . Employers need employees largely to the extent they can substitute employees for machines , and employees need employers largely to the extent they can become self - employed entrepreneurs . An uneducated population is therefore more susceptible to bearing the burden because they are more easily replaced by machines able to do unskilled work , and because they have less knowledge of how to make money on their own . Taxes on easily substitutable goods , such as oranges and tangerines , may be borne mostly by the producer because the demand curve for easily substitutable goods is quite elastic . Similarly , taxes on a business that can easily be relocated are likely to be borne almost entirely by the residents of the taxing jurisdiction and not the owners of the business . The burden of tariffs ( import taxes ) on imported vehicles might fall largely on the producers of the cars because the demand curve for foreign cars might be elastic if car consumers may substitute a domestic car purchase for a foreign car purchase . If consumers drive the same number of miles regardless of gas prices , then a tax on gasoline will be paid for by consumers and not oil companies ( this is assuming that the price elasticity of supply of oil is high ) . Who actually bears the economic burden of the tax is not affected by whether government collects the tax at the pump or directly from oil companies . Assessment ( edit ) Assessing tax incidence is a major economics subfield within the field of public finance . Most public finance economists acknowledge that nominal tax incidence ( i.e. who writes the check to pay a tax ) is not necessarily identical to actual economic burden of the tax , but disagree greatly among themselves on the extent to which market forces disturb the nominal tax incidence of various types of taxes in various circumstances . The effects of certain kinds of taxes , for example , the property tax , including their economic incidence , efficiency properties and distributional implications , have been the subject of a long and contentious debate among economists . The empirical evidence tends support different economic models under different circumstances . For example , empirical evidence on property tax incidents tends to support one economic model , known as the `` benefit tax '' view in suburban areas , while tending to support another economic model , known as the `` capital tax '' view in urban and rural areas . There is an inherent conflict in any model between considering many factors , which complicates the model and makes it hard to apply , and using a simple model , which may limit the circumstances in which its predictions are empirically useful . Lower and higher taxes were tested in the United States from 1980 to 2010 and it was found that the periods of greatest economic growth occurred during periods of higher taxation . This does not prove causation . It is possible that the time of higher economic growth provided government with more leeway to impose higher taxes .

Factors such as the price elasticity of supply and demand influence how the economic burden is divided between producers and consumers. For example, in the case of oil, whether the government collects the tax at the pump or directly from oil companies does not affect who bears the economic burden. Additionally, different economic models suggest that the incidence can vary depending on the type of tax and context, such as the property tax incidence differing between suburban (benefit tax view) and urban or rural areas (capital tax view). Overall, tax incidence depends on the responsiveness of buyers and sellers to price changes and the specific market conditions.",

Cigarette demand is generally inelastic because many smokers are addicted and less sensitive to price changes. When a government imposes a tax on cigarettes, the increased cost is largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Because consumers continue to buy cigarettes despite the price increase, they bear most of the tax burden. This aligns with the principle that the group with more inelastic demand bears a greater share of the tax incidence.",

In this case, producers bear more of the tax burden because they cannot easily reduce the quantity supplied despite the tax-induced price increase, while consumers are sensitive to price changes and reduce their quantity demanded significantly. For instance, if a tax is imposed on a good with inelastic supply, producers end up absorbing a larger portion of the tax cost. A real-world example might be a tax on agricultural products where farmers cannot quickly adjust their output, leading them to bear more of the tax burden, especially if consumers can easily switch to alternative goods.",

Contents ( hide ) 1 Origins 2 Other uses 3 See also 4 References Origins ( edit ) The term goes back to the early 1900s , and is alleged to have originated when a ship run by British officers and a Chinese crew practiced a fire drill for a fire in the engine room . The bucket brigade drew water from the starboard side , took it to the engine room , and poured it onto the ' fire ' . To prevent flooding , a separate crew hauled the accumulated water from the engine room , up to the main deck and heaved the water over the port side . The drill had previously gone according to plan until the orders became confused in translation . The bucket brigade began to draw the water from the starboard side , run over to the port side and then throw the water overboard , bypassing the engine room completely . Additionally , the term is documented to have been used in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II , where it was often expressed in the phrase `` as screwed up as a Chinese fire drill '' . It was also commonly used by Americans during the Korean War and the Vietnam War . Historians trace Westerners ' use of the word Chinese to denote `` confusion '' and `` incomprehensibility '' to the earliest contacts between Europeans and Chinese people in the 1600s , and attribute it to Europeans ' inability to understand and appreciate China 's radically different culture and world view . In his 1989 Dictionary of Invective , British editor Hugh Rawson lists 16 phrases that use the word Chinese to denote `` incompetence , fraud and disorganization '' . Other examples of such use include : `` Chinese home run '' , a baseball term for either a home run that just barely clears the fence closest to home plate , usually in a park with an unusually short fence , and often derided as unearned or undeserved ; or a foul ball hit high and backward , i.e. , in the wrong direction .

Other uses ( edit ) The term is also used to describe an American college prank ( also known as red - light green - light ) performed by a vehicle 's occupants when stopped at a traffic light , especially when there is a need to swap drivers or fetch something from the trunk .

        "question": "Given that the term \"Chinese fire drill\" supposedly originates from chaotic naval exercises and is used to describe chaotic situations, is its use limited solely to describing general chaos, or does it have more specific applications?",
        "answer": "The term is also used to describe an American college prank (also known as red-light green-light) performed by a vehicle's occupants when stopped at a traffic light, especially when there is a need to swap drivers or fetch something from the trunk. Before the light changes to green, each occupant gets out, runs around the vehicle, and gets back inside, but not necessarily in their original seats. A lagging participant may be left behind.",
        "type": "Clarification",
        "rag_answer": "Based on the provided context, the term \"Chinese fire drill\" is primarily used to describe chaotic or confusing situations in a general sense. There is no information in the context indicating a more specific or additional meaning for the term beyond describing general chaos. Therefore, from the given information, it seems the term is used mainly to refer to general disorder or confusion.",

    "document": "Tar Heel - wikipedia Tar Heel Jump to : navigation , search For other uses , see Tar Heel ( disambiguation ) . Tar Heel is a nickname applied to the U.S. state of North Carolina and its inhabitants . It is also the nickname of the University of North Carolina athletic teams , students , alumni , and fans . The exact etymology of the nickname is unknown , but most folklore believe its roots come from the fact that tar , pitch , and turpentine created from the vast pine forests were some of North Carolina 's most important exports early in the state 's history . For a time after the American Civil War , the name Tar Heel was derogatory , but it was later reappropriated by the people of North Carolina . Because the exact history of the term is unknown , a number of legends have developed to explain it . One such legend claims it to be a nickname given during the U.S. Civil War , because of the state 's importance on the Confederate side , and the fact that the troops `` stuck to their ranks like they had tar on their heels '' . The term `` Tar Heel '' gained popularity during the Civil War . Contents ( hide ) 1 History of term 2 Legendary explanations 2.1 River fording by General Cornwallis 2.2 Ability to hold ground 2.3 Reluctant secession 2.4 Robert E. Lee quotation 3 Early known uses of the term 4 See also 5 References 6 Further reading 7 External links History of term ( edit ) Front page of the first issue of The Tar Heel , published on 23 Feb 1893 . The paper was later renamed The Daily Tar Heel . In its early years as a colony , North Carolina settlements became an important source of the naval stores tar , pitch , and turpentine , especially for the British navy . Tar and pitch were largely used to paint the bottom of wooden British ships both to seal the ship and to prevent shipworms from damaging the hull . At one time , an estimated 100,000 barrels ( 16,000 m ) of tar and pitch were shipped annually to England . After 1824 , North Carolina became the leader in the United States for naval stores . By the Civil War , North Carolina had more than 1600 turpentine distilleries , and two thirds of all turpentine in the United States came from North Carolina and one - half from the counties of Bladen and New Hanover . Historians Hugh Lefler and Albert Newsome claim in North Carolina : the History of a Southern State ( 3rd edition , 1973 ) that North Carolina led the world in production of naval stores from about 1720 to 1870 . At the time , tar was created by piling up pine logs and burning them until hot oil seeped out from a spout . The vast production of tar from North Carolina led many , including Walt Whitman , to give the derisive nickname of `` Tarboilers '' to the residents of North Carolina . North Carolina was nicknamed the `` Tar and Turpentine State '' because of this industry . Somehow , these terms evolved until the nickname Tar Heel was used to refer to residents of North Carolina and gained prominence during the American Civil War . During this time , the nickname Tar Heel was a pejorative , but starting around 1865 , the term began to be used as a source of pride . In 1893 , the students of the University of North Carolina founded a newspaper and named it The Tar Heel , which was later renamed The Daily Tar Heel . By the early 1900s the term was embraced by many as a non-derisive term for North Carolinians by those from inside and outside the state of North Carolina . Legendary explanations ( edit ) The following legends and anecdotes have arisen trying to explain the history of the term Tar Heel . River fording by general Cornwallis ( edit ) According to this legend , the troops of British General Cornwallis during the American Revolutionary War were fording what is now known as the Tar River between Rocky Mount and Battleboro when they discovered that tar had been dumped into the stream to impede the crossing of British soldiers . When they finally got across the river , they found their feet completely black with tar . Thus , the soldiers observed that anyone who waded through North Carolina rivers would acquire `` tar heels . '' Ability to hold ground ( edit ) In the third volume of Walter Clark 's Histories of the Several Regiments from North Carolina in the Great War , the author explains that the nickname came about when North Carolina troops held their ground during a battle in Virginia during the American Civil War while other supporting troops retreated . After the battle , supporting troops asked the victorious North Carolinians : `` Any more tar down in the Old North State , boys ? '' and they replied : `` No , not a bit ; old Jeff 's bought it all up . '' The supporting troops continued : `` Is that so ? What is he going to do with it ? '' The North Carolinian troops ' response : `` He is going to put it on you'ns ' heels to make you stick better in the next fight . '' Reluctant secession ( edit ) The State of North Carolina was the next to last state to secede from the United States of America , and as a result the state was nicknamed `` the reluctant state '' by others in the south . The joke circulating around at the beginning of the war went something like : `` Got any tar ? '' `` No , Jeff Davis has bought it all . '' `` What for ? '' `` To put on you fellows ' heels to make you stick . '' As the war continued , many North Carolinian troops developed smart replies to this term of ridicule : The 4th Texas Infantry lost its flag at Sharpsburg . As they were passing by the 6th North Carolina a few days afterward , the Texans called out , `` Tar Heels ! '' , and the reply was , `` If'n you had had some tar on your heels , you would have brought your flag back from Sharpsburg . '' Robert E. Lee quotation ( edit ) The book Grandfather Tales of North Carolina History ( 1901 ) states that : During the late unhappy war between the States it ( North Carolina ) was sometimes called the `` Tar - heel State , '' because tar was made in the State , and because in battle the soldiers of North Carolina stuck to their bloody work as if they had tar on their heels , and when General Lee said , `` God bless the Tar - heel boys , '' they took the name . ( p. 6 ) A letter found in 1991 ( dating from 1864 in the North Carolina `` Tar Heel Collection '' ) by North Carolina State Archivist David Olson supports the theory that Lee might have stated something similar to this . A Colonel Joseph Engelhard , describing the Battle of Ream 's Station in Virginia , wrote : `` It was a ' Tar Heel ' fight , and ... we got Gen'l Lee to thanking God , which you know means something brilliant . '' Early known uses of the term ( edit ) The earliest surviving written use of the term can be found in the diary of 2nd Lieutenant Jackson B.A. Lowrance , who wrote the following on February 6 , 1863 while in Pender County , southeastern North Carolina : `` I know now what is meant by the Piney Woods of North Carolina and the idea occurs to me that it is no wonder we are called ' Tar Heels ' . '' After the Battle of Murfreesboro in Tennessee in early January 1863 , John S. Preston of Columbia , S.C. , the commanding general , rode along the fighting line commending his troops . Before the 60th Regiment from North Carolina , Preston praised them for advancing farther than he had anticipated , concluding with : `` This is your first battle of any consequence , I believe . Indeed , you Tar Heels have done well . '' An August 1869 article in Overland Monthly magazine recounted an anecdote regarding `` a brigade of North Carolinians , who , in one of the great battles ( Chancellorsville , if I remember correctly ) failed to hold a certain hill , and were laughed at by the Mississippians for having forgotten to tar their heels that morning . Hence originated their cant name ' Tarheels ' . '' In a letter dated 1864 ( in the North Carolina `` Tar Heel Collection '' ) , a Colonel Joseph Engelhard described the Battle of Ream 's Station in Virginia . In it , he states : `` It was a ' Tar Heel ' fight , and ... we got Gen'l Lee to thanking God , which you know means something brilliant '' . North Carolina State Governor Vance said in one of his speeches to the troops : `` I do not know what to call you fellows . I can not say fellow soldiers , because I am not a soldier , nor fellow citizens , because we do not live in this state ; so I have concluded to call you fellows Tar Heels . '' A piece of sheet music , `` Wearin ' of the Grey '' , identified as `` Written by Tar Heel '' and published in Baltimore in 1866 , is probably the earliest printed use of Tar Heel . On New Year 's Day , 1868 , Stephen Powers set out from Raleigh on a walking tour that , in part , would trace in reverse the march of Gen. William T. Sherman at the end of the Civil War . As a part of his report on North Carolina , Powers described the pine woods of the state and the making of turpentine . Having entered South Carolina , he recorded in his 1872 book , Afoot & Alone , that he spent the night `` with a young man , whose family were away , leaving him all alone in a great mansion . He had been a cavalry sergeant , wore his hat on the side of his head , and had an exceedingly confidential manner . '' `` You see , sir , the Tar ‐ heels have n't no sense to spare , '' Powers quotes the sergeant as saying . `` Down there in the pines the sun do n't more'n half bake their heads . We always had to show ' em whar the Yankees was , or they 'd charge to the rear , the wrong way , you see . '' In Congress on February 10 , 1875 , an African American representative from South Carolina stated that some whites were `` the class of men thrown up by the war , that rude class of men I mean , the ' tar ‐ heels ' and the ' sand ‐ hillers , ' and the ' dirt eaters ' of the South -- it is with that class we have all our trouble ... '' Tar Heel was used in the 1884 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica , which reported that the people who lived in the region of pine forests were `` far superior to the tar heel , the nickname of the dwellers in barrens . '' In Congress in 1878 , Rep. David B. Vance , trying to persuade the government to pay one of his constituents , J.C. Clendenin , for building a road , described Clendenin in glowing phrases , concluding with : `` He is an honest man ... he is a tar ‐ heel . '' In Pittsboro on December 11 , 1879 , the Chatham Record informed its readers that Jesse Turner had been named to the Arkansas Supreme Court . The new justice was described as `` a younger brother of our respected townsman , David Turner , Esq. , and we are pleased to know that a fellow tar ‐ heel is thought so much of in the state of his adoption . '' John R. Hancock of Raleigh wrote Sen. Marion Butler on January 20 , 1899 , to commend him for his efforts to obtain pensions for Confederate veterans . This was an action , Hancock wrote , `` we Tar Heels , or a large majority of us , do most heartily commend . '' The New York Tribune stated on September 20 , 1903 , regarding some North Carolinians , that `` the men really like to work , which is all but incomprehensible to the true ' tar heel ' . '' On August 26 , 1912 , The New York Evening Post identified Josephus Daniels and Thomas J. Pence as two Tar Heels holding important posts in Woodrow Wilson 's campaign .

        "rag_answer": "The nickname \"Tar Heel\" originated from North Carolina's early and extensive production of naval stores—tar, pitch, and turpentine—derived from the vast pine forests in the state. These products were important exports used especially by the British navy to seal wooden ships and protect them from shipworms. The production of tar involved burning pine logs to extract hot oil, resulting in large quantities of tar being shipped from North Carolina. Because of this industry, North Carolina was once nicknamed the \"Tar and Turpentine State,\" and its residents were sometimes derisively called \"Tarboilers.\"\n\nThe term \"Tar Heel\" evolved from these associations and gained popularity during the American Civil War. Initially, it was a pejorative term, but starting around 1865, North Carolinians began to use it with pride. Legends also link the nickname to Civil War soldiers \"sticking to their ranks like they had tar on their heels\". By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, \"Tar Heel\" had become an accepted and embraced nickname for residents of North Carolina.",

Such legends contributed to the term evolving from a derogatory nickname into a symbol of pride and resilience among North Carolinians.",

        "type": "Clarification",
        "rag_answer": "The non-Civil War explanations for the nickname \"Tar Heel\" primarily relate to North Carolina's early and extensive production of naval stores such as tar, pitch, and turpentine. These products were derived from the state's vast pine forests and were important exports, especially used by the British navy to seal and protect wooden ships. Because of this industry, North Carolina was known as the \"Tar and Turpentine State,\" and residents were sometimes called \"Tarboilers\" or associated with tar through their work in producing these materials.\n\nAnother non-Civil War explanation involves the longstanding association of the state's economy and identity with tar production, which predates the Civil War era. This economic background is a key reason why the nickname arose independently of the wartime legends.\n\nFor more detailed accounts and specific stories, sources such as Michael W. Taylor's book *Tar Heels: How North Carolinians got their nickname*, the \"Tar Heel Collection,\" and historical articles on North Carolina's naval stores industry can provide additional insights.",

Citation 6 Geo II . c. 13 Introduced by The Rt Hon . Sir Robert Walpole , KG , KB , MP Territorial extent British America and the British West Indies Dates Royal assent 17 May 1733 Commencement 24 June 1733 ( in part ) 25 December 1733 ( entire act ) Status : Repealed The Molasses Act of March 1733 was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain ( citation 6 Geo II . c. 13 ) , which imposed a tax of six pence per gallon on imports of molasses from non-English colonies . Parliament created the act largely at the insistence of large plantation owners in the British West Indies . The Act was not passed for the purpose of raising revenue , but rather to regulate trade by making British products cheaper than those from the French West Indies . The Molasses Act greatly affected the significant colonial molasses trade . The Molasses Act of 1733 provided : ... there shall be raised , levied , collected and paid , unto and for the use of his Majesty ... , upon all rum or spirits of the produce or manufacture of any of the colonies or plantations in America , not in the possession or under the dominion of his Majesty ... , which at any time or times within or during the continuance of this act , shall be imported or brought into any of the colonies or plantations in America , which now are or hereafter may be in the possession or under the dominion of his Majesty ... , the sum of nine pence , money of Great Britain , ... for every gallon thereof , and after that rate for any greater or lesser quantity : and upon all molasses or syrups of such foreign produce or manufacture as aforesaid , which shall be imported or brought into any of the said colonies or plantations ... , the sum of six pence of like money for every gallon thereof ... ; and upon all sugars and paneles of such foreign growth , produce or manufacture as aforesaid , which shall be imported into any of the said colonies or plantations ... a duty after the rate of five shillings of like money , for every hundred weight Avoirdupois ... Historian Theodore Draper described British intent on the tax as it would affect the American colonies : Bladen ( Col. Main Bladen who was a longtime member of the British Board of Trade ) had conceived of the strategy of inflicting a prohibitive duty on imports from the French West Indies instead of simply disallowing them . When he was confronted with the argument that the proposed bill would result in the ruin of the North American colonies , he replied , `` that the duties proposed would not prove an absolute prohibition , but he owned that he meant them as something that should come very near it , for in the way the northern colonies are , they raise the French Islands at the expense of ours , and raise themselves also ( to ) o high , even to an independency . '' A large colonial molasses trade had grown between the New England and Middle colonies and the French , Dutch , and Spanish West Indian possessions . Molasses from the British West Indies , used in New England for making rum , was priced much higher than its competitors and they also had no need for the large quantities of lumber , fish , and other items offered by the colonies in exchange . The British West Indies in the first part of the 18th Century were the most important trading partner for Great Britain so Parliament was attentive to their requests . However , rather than acceding to the demands to prohibit the colonies from trading with the non-British islands , Parliament passed the prohibitively high tax on the colonies for the import of molasses from these islands . Historian John C. Miller noted that the tax : ... threatened New England with ruin , struck a blow at the economic foundations of the Middle colonies , and at the same time opened the way for the British West Indians -- whom the continental colonists regarded as their worst enemies -- to wax rich at the expense of their fellow subjects on the mainland . -- John C. Miller , Largely opposed by colonists , the tax was rarely paid , and smuggling to avoid it was prominent . If actually collected , the tax would have effectively closed that source to New England and destroyed much of the rum industry . Yet smuggling , bribery or intimidation of customs officials effectively nullified the law . Miller wrote : Against the Molasses Act , Americans had only their smugglers to depend upon -- but these redoubtable gentry proved more than a match for the British . After a brief effort to enforce the act in Massachusetts in the 1740s , the English government tacitly accepted defeat and foreign molasses was smuggled into the Northern colonies in an ever - increasing quantity . Thus the New England merchants survived -- but only by nullifying an act of Parliament . -- John C. Miller , The growing corruption of local officials and disrespect for British Law caused by this act and others like it such as the Stamp Act or Townshend Acts eventually led to the American Revolution in 1776 . This Act was replaced by the Sugar Act in 1764 . This Act halved the tax rate , but was accompanied by British intent to actually collect the tax this time . Notes ( edit ) Jump up ^ Draper pg. 100 .

The three canals are the horizontal , superior and posterior semicircular canals . Contents ( hide ) 1 Structure 1.1 Horizontal semicircular canal 1.2 Superior semicircular canal 1.3 Posterior semicircular canal 1.4 Development 2 Function 3 History 4 See also 5 References 6 Additional images 7 External links Structure ( edit ) The semicircular canals are a component of the bony labyrinth . At one end of each of the semicircular canals is a dilated sac called an osseous ampulla which is more than twice the diameter of the canal . Each ampulla contains an ampulla crest , the crista ampullaris which consists of a thick gelatinous cap called a cupula and many hair cells . The superior and posterior semicircular canals are oriented vertically at right angles to each other . The lateral semicircular canal is about a 30 - degree angle from the horizontal plane . The orientations of the canals cause a different canal to be stimulated by movement of the head in different planes . The horizontal canal detects angular acceleration of the head when the head is turned and the superior and posterior canals detect vertical head movements when the head is moved up or down . When the head changes position , the endolymph in the canals lags behind due to inertia and this acts on the cupula which bends the cilia of the hair cells . The stimulation of the hair cells sends the message to the brain that acceleration is taking place . The ampullae open into the vestibule by five orifices , one of the apertures being common to two of the canals . Among species of mammals , the size of the semicircular canals is correlated with their type of locomotion . Specifically , species that are agile and have fast , jerky locomotion have larger canals relative to their body size than those that move more cautiously . Horizontal semicircular canal ( edit ) The lateral or horizontal canal ( external semicircular canal ) is the shortest of the three canals . Movement of fluid within this canal corresponds to rotation of the head around a vertical axis ( i.e. the neck ) , or in other words rotation in the transverse plane . This occurs , for example , when you turn your head to the left and right hand sides before crossing a road It measures from 12 to 15 mm. , and its arch is directed horizontally backward and laterally ; thus each semicircular canal stands at right angles to the other two . Its ampullated end corresponds to the upper and lateral angle of the vestibule , just above the oval window , where it opens close to the ampullated end of the superior canal ; its opposite end opens at the upper and back part of the vestibule . The lateral canal of one ear is very nearly in the same plane as that of the other ; while the superior canal of one ear is nearly parallel to the posterior canal of the other . Superior semicircular canal ( edit ) The superior or anterior semicircular canal is a part of the vestibular system and detects rotations of the head in around the lateral axis , or in other words rotation in the sagittal plane . This occurs , for example , when nodding your head . It is 15 to 20 mm in length , is vertical in direction , and is placed transversely to the long axis of the petrous part of the temporal bone , on the anterior surface of which its arch forms a round projection . It describes about two - thirds of a circle . Its lateral extremity is ampullated , and opens into the upper part of the vestibule ; the opposite end joins with the upper part of the posterior canal to form the crus commune , which opens into the upper and medial part of the vestibule . Posterior semicircular canal ( edit ) The posterior semicircular canal is a part of the vestibular system that detects rotation of the head around the left - right ( frontal ) axis , or in other words rotation in the coronal plane . This occurs , for example , when you move your head to touch your shoulders , or when doing a cartwheel . It is directed superiorly , as per its nomenclature , and posteriorly , nearly parallel to the posterior surface of the petrous bone . The vestibular aqueduct is immediately medial to it . The posterior canal is part of the bony labyrinth and is used by the vestibular system to detect rotations of the head in the coronal plane . It is the longest of the three canals , measuring from 18 to 22 mm . Its lower or ampullated end opens into the lower and back part of the vestibule , its upper into the crus commune . Development ( edit ) Findings from a 2009 study demonstrated a critical late role for BMP 2b in the morphogenesis of semicircular canals in the zebrafish inner ear . It is suspected that the role of bmp2 in semicircular canal duct outgrowth is likely to be conserved between different vertebrate species . Function ( edit ) Cochlea and vestibular system See also : Balance ( ability ) and Equilibrioception Each canal is filled with a fluid called endolymph and contains motion sensors within the fluids . At the base of each canal , the bony region of the canal is enlarged which opens into the utricle and has a dilated sac at one end called the osseous ampullae . Within the ampulla is a mound of hair cells and supporting cells called crista ampullaris . These hair cells have many cytoplasmic projections on the apical surface called stereocilia which are embedded in a gelatinous structure called the cupula . As the head rotates the duct moves but the endolymph lags behind owing to inertia . This deflects the cupula and bends the stereocilia within . The bending of these stereocilia alters an electric signal that is transmitted to the brain . Within approximately 10 seconds of achieving constant motion , the endolymph catches up with the movement of the duct and the cupula is no longer affected , stopping the sensation of acceleration . The specific gravity of the cupula is comparable to that of the surrounding endolymph . Consequently , the cupula is not displaced by gravity , unlike the otolithic membranes of the utricle and saccule . As with macular hair cells , hair cells of the crista ampullaris will depolarise when the stereocilia deflect towards the kinocilium . Deflection in the opposite direction results in hyperpolarisation and inhibition . In the horizontal canal , ampullopetal flow is necessary for hair - cell stimulation , whereas ampullofugal flow is necessary in the anterior and posterior canals . This adjustment period is in part the cause of an illusion known as `` the leans '' often experienced by pilots . As a pilot enters a turn , hair cells in the semicircular canals are stimulated , telling the brain that the aircraft , and the pilot , are no longer moving in a straight line but rather making a banked turn . If the pilot were to sustain a constant rate turn , the endolymph would eventually catch up with the ducts and cease to deflect the cupula . The pilot would no longer feel as if the aircraft was in a turn . As the pilot exits the turn , the semicircular canals are stimulated to make the pilot think that they are now turning in the opposite direction rather than flying straight and level . In response to this , the pilot will often lean in the direction of the original turn in an attempt to compensate for this illusion . A more serious form of this is called a graveyard spiral . Rather than the pilot leaning in the direction of the original turn , they may actually reenter the turn . As the endolymph stabilizes , the semicircular canals stop registering the gradual turn and the aircraft slowly loses altitude until impacting with the ground . The semicircular ducts provide sensory input for experiences of rotary movements . They are oriented along the pitch , roll , and yaw axes . History ( edit ) Jean Pierre Flourens , by destroying the horizontal semicircular canal of pigeons , noted that they continue to fly in a circle , showing the purpose of the semicircular canals .

Contents ( hide ) 1 Structure 1.1 Horizontal semicircular canal 1.2 Superior semicircular canal 1.3 Posterior semicircular canal 1.4 Development 2 Function 3 History 4 See also 5 References 6 Additional images 7 External links Structure The semicircular canals are a component of the bony labyrinth . At one end of each of the semicircular canals is a dilated sac called an osseous ampulla which is more than twice the diameter of the canal . Each ampulla contains an ampulla crest , the crista ampullaris which consists of a thick gelatinous cap called a cupula and many hair cells . The superior and posterior semicircular canals are oriented vertically at right angles to each other . The lateral semicircular canal is about a 30 - degree angle from the horizontal plane . The orientations of the canals cause a different canal to be stimulated by movement of the head in different planes . The horizontal canal detects angular acceleration of the head when the head is turned and the superior and posterior canals detect vertical head movements when the head is moved up or down . When the head changes position , the endolymph in the canals lags behind due to inertia and this acts on the cupula which bends the cilia of the hair cells . The stimulation of the hair cells sends the message to the brain that acceleration is taking place . The ampullae open into the vestibule by five orifices , one of the apertures being common to two of the canals . Among species of mammals , the size of the semicircular canals is correlated with their type of locomotion . Specifically , species that are agile and have fast , jerky locomotion have larger canals relative to their body size than those that move more cautiously . Horizontal semicircular canal The lateral or horizontal canal ( external semicircular canal ) is the shortest of the three canals . Movement of fluid within this canal corresponds to rotation of the head around a vertical axis ( i.e. the neck ) , or in other words rotation in the transverse plane . This occurs , for example , when you turn your head to the left and right hand sides before crossing a road It measures from 12 to 15 mm. , and its arch is directed horizontally backward and laterally ; thus each semicircular canal stands at right angles to the other two . Its ampullated end corresponds to the upper and lateral angle of the vestibule , just above the oval window , where it opens close to the ampullated end of the superior canal ; its opposite end opens at the upper and back part of the vestibule . The lateral canal of one ear is very nearly in the same plane as that of the other ; while the superior canal of one ear is nearly parallel to the posterior canal of the other . Superior semicircular canal The superior or anterior semicircular canal is a part of the vestibular system and detects rotations of the head in around the lateral axis , or in other words rotation in the sagittal plane . This occurs , for example , when nodding your head . It is 15 to 20 mm in length , is vertical in",

The stimulation of the hair cells sends the message to the brain that acceleration is taking place . The ampullae open into the vestibule by five orifices , one of the apertures being common to two of the canals . Among species of mammals , the size of the semicircular canals is correlated with their type of locomotion . Specifically , species that are agile and have fast , jerky locomotion have larger canals relative to their body size than those that move more cautiously . Horizontal semicircular canal The lateral or horizontal canal ( external semicircular canal ) is the shortest of the three canals . Movement of fluid within this canal corresponds to rotation of the head around a vertical axis ( i.e. the neck ) , or in other words rotation in the transverse plane . This occurs , for example , when you turn your head to the left and right hand sides before crossing a road It measures from 12 to 15 mm. , and its arch is directed horizontally backward and laterally ; thus each semicircular canal stands at right angles to the other two . Its ampullated end corresponds to the upper and lateral angle of the vestibule , just above the oval window , where it opens close to the ampullated end of the superior canal ; its opposite end opens at the upper and back part of the vestibule . The lateral canal of one ear is very nearly in the same plane as that of the other ; while the superior canal of one ear is nearly parallel to the posterior canal of the other . Superior semicircular canal The superior or anterior semicircular canal is a part of the vestibular system and detects rotations of the head in around the lateral axis , or in other words rotation in the sagittal plane . This occurs , for example , when nodding your head . It is 15 to 20 mm in length , is vertical in",

McElroy Portrayed by Danielle Harris ( Halloween 4 & 5 ) J.C. Brandy ( Halloween 6 ) Information Family Laurie Strode ( deceased mother ) John Tate ( twin brother ; originally in Kevin Williamson 's screenplay ) Children Stephen Lloyd ( son ; orphaned ) Relatives Judith Myers ( deceased maternal aunt ) Michael Myers ( maternal uncle ) Jamie Lloyd is a fictional character in the Halloween franchise and the main protagonist of Halloween 4 and 5 and also appears in a less prominent role in Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers . The character was created Alan B. McElroy and portrayed by actress Danielle Harris in the fourth and fifth movies , while J.C. Brandy portrays her in the sixth . The character was created after Jamie Lee Curtis was unable to return as Laurie Strode for the fourth film due to working on another film project . She instead asked that the writers include her character 's death from an automobile accident in the plot . The fourth film introduced Laurie 's daughter , Jamie Lloyd . As the daughter of Laurie , she is also the niece of infamous serial killer Michael Myers and his first victim , Judith Myers .

Wilbur ) . She is also tormented by schoolmates because she is related to Haddonfield 's notorious `` boogeyman '' . On October 30 , 1988 , Michael is being transferred out of Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium back to Smith 's Grove . While in the transfer ambulance , he recovers from his ten - year coma upon learning the existence of his niece . Accordingly , he kills the two medical attendants and the two drivers . While making his way back to his hometown , he also kills a mechanic and a waitress . In Haddonfield , while on the trail for Jamie , Michael kills the Carruthers ' Golden Retriever Sundae , a worker at the power plant which causes a blackout of the entire town , the entire police force , the deputy , the police chief 's daughter Kelly , Rachel 's boyfriend Brady , and 4 men from a vigilante mob . Escaping from town , Jamie cowers in a pick - up truck as Rachel hits Michael head on , throwing him off the road and knocking him out . Despite Rachel 's orders , Jamie goes over to him and holds his hand . The police tell Jamie to drop to the ground and shoot Michael many times , causing him to fall into an abandoned mine shaft , which then collapses on top of him . Later , back in her foster home , Jamie is possessed by Michael 's spirit and stabs her foster mother , though not fatally . When screams are heard from upstairs , Dr. Loomis walks over to the staircase seeing Jamie poised at the top holding a pair of bloody scissors . Sheriff Ben Meeker ( Beau Starr ) restrains Loomis from shooting her . Jamie is now apparently consumed by Michael 's rage . Halloween 5 : the revenge of Michael Myers ( edit ) Main article : Halloween 5 : The Revenge of Michael Myers One year later , a severely traumatized Jamie is housed in the Haddonfield Children 's Clinic . She has now been rendered mute and suffers from nightmares and seizures . Early in the film , a brick , bearing a note reading , `` The evil child must die , '' is thrown through her window . When Michael ( Donald L. Shanks ) awakens from a year - long coma , she develops a telepathic bond with him . Sensing when he is near someone , Jamie goes into convulsions when he kills . Michael kills Rachel , four of Rachel 's friends , two dimwitted cops , and the Carruthers ' new dog , a Doberman Pinscher named Max , while in pursuit of Jamie . Towards the end , Loomis takes Jamie to the old Myers house and successfully lures Michael into the house . Despite the doctor 's pleas with Michael to fight his rage and seek redemption through a positive relationship with Jamie , Myers tracks down his niece in Judith Myers 's deserted bedroom . This leads to a chase scene throughout Michael 's childhood home . Jamie attempts to reach Michael by addressing him as `` Uncle . '' He pauses and , at Jamie 's request , removes his mask . Upon seeing his face , she says `` You 're just like me . '' However , when she tries to wipe away a tear from his face , he recoils , puts his mask back on , and attacks her in a rage . Using Jamie as bait , Loomis catches Michael in a net , shoots him with tranquilizer darts , and beats him into unconsciousness with a wooden beam . Michael is manacled and locked up in the local jail , awaiting transport to a maximum - security facility , where , Meeker says , he will remain `` until the day he dies , '' to which Jamie responds , `` He 'll never die . '' After Jamie is escorted out to be taken home , the mysterious `` Man in Black '' , glimpsed briefly earlier in the film , arrives at the police station and begins firing a machine gun . Jamie goes back inside to find that eight police officers have been gunned down ( including Meeker ) and that her uncle has escaped , prompting her to begin sobbing in terror . Halloween : the Curse of Michael Myers ( edit ) Main article : Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers Six years later , now 15 - year - old Jamie , having a cameo appearance in the beginning of the film , gives birth to a boy on the night of October 30 , 1995 . The Man in Black had apparently kidnapped her immediately after the shoot - out and has kept her and Michael ( George P. Wilbur ) in captivity for the past six years . Dr. Loomis and Tommy Doyle ( Paul Rudd ) , whom Laurie Strode was babysitting on Halloween 1978 , attempt to rescue Jamie after hearing her plea for help on a local radio station . Before being killed by Michael , Jamie hides her baby , who is found by Tommy . The Man in Black in the end is revealed to be Loomis ' former medical colleague Dr. Terence Wynn ( Mitchell Ryan ) . He and most of his staff are revealed to be a Druid cult headquartered in the subterranean levels of the Smith 's Grove Sanitarium , the place where Michael was committed after killing his sister Judith . They are responsible for Michael 's actions , placing an ancient curse on him to kill his family to ward off sickness and death . By the end of the movie , it is implied that Dr. Wynn has been trying and failing to breed the ultimate evil using Michael 's DNA and female patients of the sanitarium in in - vitro fertilisation experiments ; finally reaching a success with Jamie 's baby after she had been tested on . In the theatrical version , Jamie dies relatively early in the film when Michael impales her on a corn thresher and turning it on , disemboweling her . In the producer 's cut , she survives most of the film only to be shot in the head by a gun fitted with a silencer by Wynn . Continuity ( edit ) When screenwriter Kevin Williamson first outlined Halloween H20 , he created the storyline in which Laurie Strode has faked her own death and taken on a new identity as a specific way of retconning the character 's death in Halloween 4 . In Williamson 's original treatment , there are scenes in which a Hillcrest student does a report on Michael Myers ' killing spree , mentioning the death of Jamie , complete with flashbacks to 4 - 6 mentioned in the text . `` Keri '' / Laurie responds to hearing the student 's report on the death of her daughter by going into a restroom and throwing up . In a controversial decision , director Steve Miner retconned the series with Halloween H20 : 20 Years Later ( 1998 ) . This installment retained Laurie 's faked death from Williamson 's treatment , revealing that she did so in order to avoid detection by her relentless brother . Under a new identity , Laurie has fled to Summer Glen , California , along with her only son , John Tate ( Josh Hartnett ) . However , to focus more on the Laurie Strode character , the events of parts 4 , 5 , and 6 are written out of the continuity , thus erasing the Jamie Lloyd character from the canon . The official Halloween : 30 Years of Terror comic book , taking place in the new continuity , has an adult Tommy Doyle illustrating comic books . Various elements from the fourth through sixth movies can be seen on his books , one of which is Jamie . The upcoming comic Halloween : The Mark of Thorn will feature Jamie , as well as Tommy Doyle , Rachel Carruthers and the Man in Black . Casting ( edit ) Jamie Lloyd was Danielle Harris ' first feature film role , for which she appears at horror conventions and on Halloween series - related websites . Actress Melissa Joan Hart also auditioned for the role . Harris sought to reprise the role for the sixth installment , now titled Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers , but the producers and Dimension Films reportedly refused to pay her the $5,000 she requested , and she was n't fond of the script . The role was instead given to actress J.C. Brandy , who was a Halloween fan herself . Harris made her eventual return to the series as Annie Brackett in Rob Zombie 's Halloween remake , as well as its subsequent sequel . Other notes ( edit ) In the films , the uncertainty of Jamie 's age stems from a discrepancy between Halloween 4 and 5 . In the former film , set in late October 1988 , Jamie 's foster sister , Rachel Carruthers ( Ellie Cornell ) wonders why Jamie continues staying up so late . She asks , `` You are going for a record here ? The Seven - Year - Old Insomniacs ' Hall of Fame ? '' , suggesting that she is born in 1981 . The latter film is set one year later in late October 1989 . Rachel and Jamie 's adolescent friend Tina Williams ( Wendy Kaplan ) exclaims to Dr. Sam Loomis ( Donald Pleasence ) that `` Jamie 's a nine - year - old girl ! '' In the novelization of the fourth film , Halloween IV ( 1988 ; revised edition , 2003 ) by Nicholas Grabowsky , Jamie is six years old , which implicitly dates her birth to 1982 . According to H4 , Laurie legally died 11 months earlier in November 1987 and Richard and Darlene Carruthers are Jamie 's foster parents . In H5 , it is apparent that Jamie had been adopted assuming the name `` Jamie Carruthers '' .

    "document": "Mining industry of Nigeria - wikipedia Mining industry of Nigeria Jump to : navigation , search The mining of minerals in Nigeria accounts for only 0.3 % of its GDP , due to the influence of its vast oil resources . The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped , leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically , such as salt or iron ore . Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria , which grants titles to organizations to explore , mine , and sell mineral resources . Organized mining began in 1903 when the Mineral Survey of the Northern Protectorates was created by the British colonial government . A year later , the Mineral Survey of the Southern Protectorates was founded . By the 1940s , Nigeria was a major producer of tin , columbite , and coal . The discovery of oil in 1956 hurt the mineral extraction industries , as government and industry both began to focus on this new resource . The Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s led many expatriate mining experts to leave the country . Mining regulation is handled by the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development , which oversees the management of all mineral resources . Mining law is codified in the Federal Minerals and Mining Act of 1999 . Historically , Nigeria 's mining industry was monopolized by state - owned public corporations . This led to a decline in productivity in almost all mineral industries . The Obasanjo administration began a process of selling off government - owned corporations to private investors in 1999 . Contents ( hide ) 1 Coal , Lignite and Coke 2 Gold 3 Columbite Wolframite and Tantalite 4 Bitumen 5 Iron Ore 6 Uranium 7 Ecological effects 8 References 9 External links Coal , lignite and coke ( edit ) Main article : Nigerian Coal Corporation Mining is the extraction ( removal ) of minerals and metals from the earth . The Nigerian Coal Corporation ( NCC ) is a parastatal corporation that was formed in 1950 and held a monopoly on the mining , processing , and sales of coal , lignite , and coke products until 1999 . Coal was first discovered in Enugu in 1909 , and the Ogbete Mine had opened and begun regularly extracting coal by 1916 . By 1920 , coal production had reached 180,122 long tons ( 183,012 t ) . Nigeria 's peak coal production was in the late 1950s , and by 1960 production was at 565,681 long tons ( 574,758 t ) . The Nigerian Civil War caused many mines to be abandoned . After the war ended in the early 1970s , coal production was never able to recover . Attempts to mechanize the industry in the 1970s and 1980s were ultimately unsuccessful , and actually hindered production due to problems with implementation and maintenance . The Nigerian government is currently trying to privatize the Nigerian Coal Corporation and sell off its assets . While the domestic market for coal has been negatively affected by the move to diesel and gas - powered engines by organizations that were previously major coal consumers , the low - sulfur coal mined in Nigeria is desirable by international customers in Italy and the United Kingdom , who have imported Nigerian coal . Recent financial problems have caused a near shutdown of the NCC 's coal mining operations , and the corporation has responded by attempting to sell off some of its assets while it waits for the government to complete privatization activities . In April 2008 , Minister of Mines and Steel Sarafa Tunji Ishola announced that Nigeria was considering coal as an alternative power source as it attempts to reform its power sector , and encouraged Chinese investors to invest in the coal industry . The Nigerian Mining Cadastre Office manages all the Nigerian mining licenses and mining rights . They are a subsiary of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development of the Federal Republic of Nigeria . Gold ( edit ) Illegal miners in Itagun , Osun State , gathering their gold finds in pan Gold deposits are found in Northern Nigeria , most prominently near Maru , Anka , Malele , Tsohon Birnin Gwari - Kwaga , Gurmana , Bin Yauri , Okolom - Dogondaji , and Iperindo in Osun state it is not very dominant in the country . Gold production began in 1913 and peaked in the 1930s . During the Second World War , production declined . Mines were abandoned by colonial companies , and production never recovered . The Nigerian Mining Corporation ( NMC ) was formed in the early 1980s to explore for gold . Lack of funds , and the lure of easier profits from oil production led to its failure . There is no large scale gold mining operation in Nigeria today , though there is small - scale mining carried out by artists . The family of Aleye from Anka is one of the leading gold families in the region . Columbite wolframite and tantalite ( edit ) Columbite and Tantalite are ores used to produce the elements niobium and tantalum . Columbite and tantalite are collectively known as coltan in Africa . Tantalum is a valuable rare element used in electronics manufacturing . In Nigeria , pegmatite deposits of coltan are frequently also the source of several precious and semi-precious stones such as beryl , aquamarine , and tourmaline . These pegmatites are found in Nassarawa State near the Jos Plateau , as well as in several areas in southeast Nigeria . There is small - scale mining of these minerals . Wolframite ( tungsten ) can be found in the North states . Bitumen ( edit ) Bitumen was first discovered in 1900 , with focused exploration beginning in 1905 . Bitumen deposits are found in Lagos State , Ogun State , Ondo State , and Edo State . Conoco has performed a technical and economic evaluation of these deposits , and believes there to be over thirteen billion barrels of oil in these tar sands and bitumen seepages . Iron ore ( edit ) Nigeria has several deposits of iron ore , but the purest deposits are in and around Itakpe in Kogi State . The National Iron Ore Mining Company was founded in 1979 and given the mission to explore , exploit , process , and supply iron ore concentrate to the Ajaokuta Steel Company ( ASCL ) in Ajaokuta and Delta Steel Company ( DCL ) in Aladja . Additional demand has come from several steel rolling mills . The company and its mining operations are based in Kogi State . Export of excess iron ore beyond what is required for domestic needs is currently being explored . Additionally , the Nigerian government has invested in foreign iron ore operations in Guinea. 3 Uranium ( edit ) The Nigeria Uranium Mining Company ( NUMCO ) was a parastatal organization that controlled the exploration and mining of uranium in Nigeria and was a public / private partnership with Total Compagnie Minière of France , which owned 40 % of the company . In 1989 , Total pulled out of the partnership , and in 1993 the government reassigned NUMCO 's responsibilities to the Nigerian Geological Survey . The NUMCO corporation was dissolved in 1996 , and the government is in the process of liquidating its remaining assets . Recently , several important uranium deposits were discovered in Cross River State , Adamawa State , Taraba State , Plateau State , Bauchi State , and Kano State by the British Geological Survey . Ecological effects ( edit ) Environmental officials with the government of Plateau State believe that 1,100 tin and columbite mines , abandoned after the mining boom of the 1960s , now pose serious health risks to as many as 2 million people living in the area . Radioactive mine tailings were reported to be a danger to local people living around mining fields in Jos , Barikin - Ladi , Bukur , Bassa and Riyom districts .

Recent financial problems have caused a near shutdown of the NCC 's coal mining operations , and the corporation has responded by attempting to sell off some of its assets while it waits for the government to complete privatization activities . In April 2008 , Minister of Mines and Steel Sarafa Tunji Ishola announced that Nigeria was considering coal as an alternative power source as it attempts to reform its power sector , and encouraged Chinese investors to invest in the coal industry . The Nigerian Mining Cadastre Office manages all the Nigerian mining licenses and mining rights . They are a subsiary of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development of the Federal Republic of Nigeria . Gold Illegal miners in Itagun , Osun State , gathering their gold finds in pan Gold deposits are found in Northern Nigeria , most prominently near Maru ,",

        "question": "Given that the mining industry in Nigeria was at its peak in the late 1950s, what factors led to its subsequent decline?",
        "answer": "The discovery of oil in 1956 hurt the mineral extraction industries , as government and industry both began to focus on this new resource . The Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s led many expatriate mining experts to leave the country . Historically , Nigeria 's mining industry was monopolized by state - owned public corporations . This led to a decline in productivity in almost all mineral industries .",
        "type": "Follow-up",
        "rag_answer": "The decline of the mining industry in Nigeria after the 1950s was caused by several factors, including the financial difficulties faced by organizations such as the Nigerian Coal Corporation, which eventually became broke and had to sell its assets. Additionally, issues related to the privatization and management of solid mineral sectors, as well as challenges with radioactive waste and environmental concerns, likely contributed to the decline. The shift towards other energy sources, such as electricity, also played a role in reducing the reliance on coal mining.",

    "document": "Morpheme - wikipedia Morpheme Jump to : navigation , search This article includes a list of references , but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations . Please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations . ( July 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Examples `` Unbreakable '' comprises three morphemes : un - ( a bound morpheme signifying `` not '' ) , - break - ( the root , a free morpheme ) , and - able ( a free morpheme signifying `` can be done '' ) . Allomorphs of the plural morpheme for regular nouns : / s / ( e.g. in cats / kæts / ) , / ɪz , əz / ( e.g. in dishes / dɪʃɪz / ) , and / z / ( e.g. in dogs / dɒɡz / ) . A morpheme is the smallest grammatical unit in a language . In other words , it is the smallest meaningful unit of a language . The linguistics field of study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology . A morpheme is not identical to a word , and the principal difference between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone , whereas a word , by definition , is freestanding . When a morpheme stands by itself , it is considered as a root because it has a meaning of its own ( e.g. the morpheme cat ) and when it depends on another morpheme to express an idea , it is an affix because it has a grammatical function ( e.g. the -- s in cats to indicate that it is plural ) . Every word comprises one or more morphemes . Contents ( hide ) 1 Classification of morphemes 1.1 Free and bound morphemes 1.1. 1 Classification of bound morphemes 1.1. 1.1 Derivational morphemes 1.1. 1.2 Inflectional morphemes 1.2 Allomorphs 1.3 Zero morphemes / null morphemes 1.4 Content vs. function 2 Other features of morphemes 3 Morphological analysis 4 Changing definitions of morpheme 5 See also 5.1 Linguistics 5.2 Lexicology 6 References 7 External links Classification of morphemes ( edit ) Free and bound morphemes ( edit ) Main article : Bound and unbound morphemes Every morpheme can be classified as either free or bound . These categories are mutually exclusive , and as such , a given morpheme will belong to exactly one of them . Free morphemes can function independently as words ( e.g. town , dog ) and can appear within lexemes ( e.g. town hall , doghouse ) . Bound morphemes appear only as parts of words , always in conjunction with a root and sometimes with other bound morphemes . For example , un - appears only accompanied by other morphemes to form a word . Most bound morphemes in English are affixes , particularly prefixes and suffixes . Examples of suffixes are - tion , - ation , - ible , - ing , etc . Bound morphemes that are not affixed are called cranberry morphemes . Classification of bound morphemes ( edit ) Bound morphemes can be further classified as derivational or inflectional . Derivational morphemes ( edit ) Derivational morphemes , when combined with a root , change either the semantic meaning or part of speech of the affected word . For example , in the word happiness , the addition of the bound morpheme - ness to the root happy changes the word from an adjective ( happy ) to a noun ( happiness ) . In the word unkind , un - functions as a derivational morpheme , for it inverts the meaning of the word formed by the root kind . Generally , the affixes used with a root word are bound morphemes . Inflectional morphemes ( edit ) Inflectional morphemes modify a verb 's tense , aspect , mood , person , or number , or a noun 's , pronoun 's or adjective 's number , gender or case , without affecting the word 's meaning or class ( part of speech ) . Examples of applying inflectional morphemes to words are adding - s to the root dog to form dogs and adding - ed to wait to form waited . An inflectional morpheme changes the form of a word . In English , there are eight inflections . Allomorphs ( edit ) Allomorphs are variants of a morpheme that differ in pronunciation but are semantically identical . For example , in English , the plural marker - ( e ) s of regular nouns can be pronounced / - z / , / - s / , or / - ɪz , - əz / , depending on the final sound of the noun 's Grammatical number singular form . For example , plural ending s ( as in bats ) , z ( as in bugs ) , iz ( as in buses ) . Zero morphemes / null morphemes ( edit ) Generally , these types of morphemes have no visible changes . For instance , the singular form of sheep is `` sheep '' and its plural is also `` sheep '' . The intended meaning is thus derived from the co-occurring determiner ( e.g. in this case `` some - '' or `` a - '' ) . Content vs. function ( edit ) Content morphemes express a concrete meaning or content , while function morphemes have more of a grammatical role . For example , the morphemes fast and sad can be considered content morphemes . On the other hand , the suffix -- ed belongs to the function morphemes given that it has the grammatical function of indicating past tense . Although these categories seem very clear and intuitive , the idea behind it can be harder to grasp given that they overlap with each other . Examples of an ambiguous situation are the preposition over and the determiner your , which seem to have a concrete meaning , but are considered function morphemes because their role is to connect ideas grammatically . A general rule to follow to determine the category of a morpheme is : Content morphemes include free morphemes that are nouns , adverbs , adjectives , and verbs . It also includes bound morphemes that are bound roots and derivational affixes . Function morphemes can be free morphemes that are prepositions , pronouns , determiners , and conjunctions . Additionally , they can be bound morphemes that are inflectional affixes . Other features of morphemes ( edit ) Roots are composed of only one morpheme , while stems can be composed of more than one morpheme . Any additional affixes are considered morphemes . An example of this is the word quirkiness . The root is quirk , but the stem is quirky which has two morphemes . Moreover , there exist pairs of affixes that have the same phonological form but have a different meaning . For example , the suffix -- er can be derivative ( e.g. sell ⇒ seller ) or inflectional ( e.g. small ⇒ smaller ) . These types of morphemes are called homophonous . Some words might seem to be composed of multiple morphemes , but in fact , they are not . This is why one has to consider form and meaning when identifying morphemes . For example , the word relate might seem to be composed of two morphemes , re - ( prefix ) and the word late , but this is not correct . These morphemes have no relationship with the definitions relevant to the word like `` feel sympathy '' , `` narrate '' , or `` being connected by blood or marriage '' . Furthermore , the length of the words does not determine if it has multiple morphemes or not . To demonstrate , the word Madagascar is long and it might seem to have morphemes like mad , gas , and car , but it does not . Conversely , small words can have multiple morphemes ( e.g. dogs ) . Morphological analysis ( edit ) This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( October 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In natural language processing for Korean , Japanese , Chinese and other languages , morphological analysis is the process of segmenting a sentence into a row of morphemes . Morphological analysis is closely related to part - of - speech tagging , but word segmentation is required for these languages because word boundaries are not indicated by blank spaces . The purpose of the morphological analysis is to determine the minimal units of meaning in a language or morphemes by using comparisons of similar forms -- for example , comparing forms such as `` She is walking '' and `` They are walking '' rather than comparing either of these with something completely different like `` You are reading '' . Thus , we can effectively break down the forms in parts and distinguish the different morphemes . Similarly , the meaning and the form are equally important for the identification of morphemes . For instance , agent and comparative morphemes illustrate this point . An agent morpheme is an affix like - er that transforms a verb into a noun ( e.g. teach → teacher ) . On the other hand , -- er can also be a comparative morpheme that changes an adjective into another degree of the same adjective ( e.g. small → smaller ) . In this case , the form is the same , but the meaning of both morphemes is different . Also , the opposite can occur in which the meaning is the same but the form is different . Changing definitions of morpheme ( edit ) This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( September 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In generative grammar , the definition of a morpheme depends heavily on whether syntactic trees have morphemes as leaves or features as leaves . Direct surface - to - syntax mapping in lexical functional grammar ( LFG ) -- leaves are words Direct syntax - to - semantics mapping Leaves in syntactic trees spell out morphemes : distributed morphology -- leaves are morphemes Branches in syntactic trees spell out morphemes : radical minimalism and nanosyntax -- leaves are `` nano - '' ( small ) morpho - syntactic features Given the definition of a morpheme as `` the smallest meaningful unit '' , nanosyntax aims to account for idioms where it is often an entire syntactic tree which contributes `` the smallest meaningful unit . '' An example idiom is `` Do n't let the cat out of the bag '' where the idiom is composed of `` let the cat out of the bag '' and that might be considered a semantic morpheme , which is composed of many syntactic morphemes . Other cases where the `` smallest meaningful unit '' is larger than a word include some collocations such as `` in view of '' and `` business intelligence '' where the words together have a specific meaning . The definition of morphemes also plays a significant role in the interfaces of generative grammar in the following theoretical constructs ; Event semantics : the idea that each productive morpheme must have a compositional semantic meaning ( a denotation ) , and if the meaning is there , there must be a morpheme ( null or overt ) . Spell - out : the interface where syntactic / semantic structures are `` spelled - out '' using words or morphemes with phonological content . This can also be thought of as lexical insertion into the syntactic .

Please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations . ( July 2013 ) Examples `` Unbreakable '' comprises three morphemes : un - ( a bound morpheme signifying `` not '' ) , - break - ( the root , a free morpheme ) , and - able ( a free morpheme signifying `` can be done '' ) . Allomorphs of the plural morpheme for regular nouns : / s / ( e.g. in cats / kæts / ) , / ɪz , əz / ( e.g. in dishes / dɪʃɪz / ) , and / z / ( e.g. in dogs / dɒɡz / ) . A morpheme is the smallest grammatical unit in a language . In other words , it is the smallest meaningful unit of a language . The linguistics field of study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology . A morpheme is not identical to a word , and the principal difference between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone , whereas a word , by definition , is freestanding . When a morpheme stands by itself , it is considered as a root because it has a meaning of its own ( e.g. the morpheme cat ) and when it depends on another morpheme to express an idea , it is an affix because it has a grammatical function ( e.g. the -- s in cats to indicate that it is plural ) . Every word comprises one or more morphemes .

These categories are mutually exclusive , and as such , a given morpheme will belong to exactly one of them . Free morphemes can function independently as words ( e.g. town , dog ) and can appear within lexemes ( e.g. town hall , doghouse ) . Bound morphemes appear only as parts of words , always in conjunction with a root and sometimes with other bound morphemes . For example , un - appears only accompanied by other morphemes to form a word . Most bound morphemes in English are affixes , particularly prefixes and suffixes . Examples of suffixes are - tion , - ation , - ible , - ing , etc . Bound morphemes that are not affixed are called cranberry morphemes . Classification of bound morphemes Bound morphemes can be further classified as derivational or inflectional . Derivational morphemes Derivational morphemes , when combined with a root , change either the semantic meaning or part of speech of the affected word . For example , in the word happiness , the addition of the bound morpheme - ness to the root happy changes the word from an adjective ( happy ) to a noun ( happiness ) . In the word unkind , un - functions as a derivational morpheme , for it inverts the meaning of the word formed by the root kind . Generally , the affixes used with a root word are bound morphemes . Inflectional morphemes Inflectional morphemes modify a verb 's tense , aspect , mood , person , or number , or a noun 's , pronoun 's or adjective 's number , gender or case , without affecting the word 's meaning or class ( part of speech ) . Examples of applying inflectional morphemes to words are adding - s to the root dog to form dogs and adding - ed to wait to form waited . An inflectional morpheme changes the form of a word . In English , there are eight inflections . Allomorphs Allomorphs are variants of a morpheme that differ in pronunciation but are semantically identical . For example , in English , the plural marker - ( e ) s of regular nouns can be pronounced / - z / , / - s / , or / - ɪz , - əz / , depending on the final",

For example , plural ending s ( as in bats ) , z ( as in bugs ) , iz ( as in buses ) . Zero morphemes / null morphemes Generally , these types of morphemes have no visible changes . For instance , the singular form of sheep is `` sheep '' and its plural is also `` sheep '' . The intended meaning is thus derived from the co-occurring determiner ( e.g. in this case `` some - '' or `` a - '' ) . Content vs. function Content morphemes express a concrete meaning or content , while function morphemes have more of a grammatical role . For example , the morphemes fast and sad can be considered content morphemes . On the other hand , the suffix -- ed belongs to the function morphemes given that it has the grammatical function of indicating past tense . Although these categories seem very clear and intuitive , the idea behind it can be harder to grasp given that they overlap with each other . Examples of an ambiguous situation are the preposition over and the determiner your , which seem to have a concrete meaning , but are considered function morphemes because their role is to connect ideas grammatically . A general rule to follow to determine the category of a morpheme is : Content morphemes include free morphemes that are nouns , adverbs , adjectives , and verbs . It also includes bound morphemes that are bound roots and derivational affixes . Function morphemes can be free morphemes that are prepositions , pronouns , determiners , and conjunctions . Additionally , they can be bound morphemes that are inflectional affixes . Other features of morphemes Roots are composed of only one morpheme , while stems can be composed of more than one morpheme . Any additional affixes are considered morphemes . An example of this is the word quirkiness . The root is quirk , but the stem is quirky which has two morphemes . Moreover , there exist pairs of affixes that have the same phonological form but have a different meaning . For example , the suffix -- er can be derivative ( e.g. sell ⇒ seller ) or inflectional ( e.g. small ⇒ smaller ) . These types of morphemes are called homophonous . Some words might seem to be composed of multiple morphemes , but in fact , they are not . This is why one has to consider form and meaning when identifying morphemes . For example , the word relate might seem to be composed of two morphemes , re - ( prefix ) and the word late , but this is not correct . These morphemes have no relationship with the definitions relevant to the word like `` feel sympathy '' , `` narrate '' , or `` being connected by blood or marriage '' . Furthermore , the length of the words does not determine if it has multiple morphemes or not . To demonstrate , the word Madagascar is long and it might seem to have morphemes like mad , gas , and car , but it does not . Conversely , small words can have multiple morphemes ( e.g. dogs ) . Morphological analysis This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( October 2017 ) In natural language processing for Korean , Japanese , Chinese and other languages , morphological analysis is the process of segmenting a sentence into a row of morphemes . Morphological analysis is closely related to part - of - speech tagging , but word segmentation is required for these languages because word boundaries are not indicated by blank spaces . The purpose of the morphological analysis is to determine the minimal units of meaning in a language or morphemes by using comparisons of similar forms -- for example , comparing forms such as `` She is walking '' and `` They are walking '' rather than comparing either of these with something completely different like `` You are",

Please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations . ( March 2010 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) See also : Ministers to Elizabeth I England under Elizabeth I 's reign , the Elizabethan Era , was ruled by the very structured and complicated Elizabethan government . It was divided into the national bodies ( the monarch , Privy Council , and Parliament ) , the regional bodies ( the Council of the North and Council of the Marches ) , the county , community bodies and the court system . Elizabeth I had a very tough time gaining power , this was because her dad , Henry VIII , wanted a male heir so the family name would continue . When Henry finally got his male heir , Edward VI , he became the new successor . However when Henry died Edward was only 9 years old , and so he had advisers who ran the country for him . But at the age of 15 Edward dies , Mary I becomes the first female Queen , and takes the name of ' bloody Mary ' . She took this name because of all the protestants she executed for being of a different religion . When Mary dies , Elizabeth becomes Queen however that was n't the end of the hardship .

The government was very much a personal monarchy with ministers . The monarch 's personality determined the style , intensity , and efficiency . Back then , the monarch was a ruler , unlike the modern monarchs who are more like figureheads . The monarch was the ultimate decider and was able to determine issues of national religion , when Parliament would sit and what it would discuss , when and if the country would go to war , matters of education , welfare of the citizens , what food they could eat , and what clothes they could wear . She also had various counselors and officials to aid her rule. The queen could choose who would help her govern . The Divine Right of Kings gave the monarch the image of a Demigod . This strengthened authority made going against the monarch considered a sin . Not obeying the queen was considered treason and was punishable by death . The queen had the power to send one to prison and order executions . All laws required her consent to be passed . Generally , she could not pass laws herself -- she had to draw up a Bill and put it forward to Parliament . However , she could make Royal Proclamations without Parliament 's consent . Even with this much power , the monarch was not above the law , and she could be brought to court . Elizabeth is considered by many to be one of England 's best monarchs . She was wise and just , chose good advisers and was n't dominated by them , dealt with the stubbornly resistant Parliaments without being tyrannous , and was skilled at compromising in both religious and political matters . She ruled for 45 years and was the sixth and last of the Tudor dynasty . Sir William Cecil Sir William Cecil ( named Lord Burghley in 1571 ) was her chief adviser and supervised the whole administration . He was also Secretary of State from 1558 to 1572 and Lord Treasurer from 1572 to his death in 1598 . Sir Francis Walsingham was famous for uncovering many Catholic plots against Elizabeth ; he filled in as Secretary of State from 1572 to his death in 1590 . Sir Robert Cecil , second son of Sir William Cecil , was Secretary of State in 1596 and master of Court of Wards after a clash with Robert Devereux , Earl of Essex . He then became dominant in the government . Sir Nicholas Bacon , Sir Francis Bacon , Sir Francis Knollys , and Sir Walter Mildmay were important bureaucrats of Elizabeth . Along with these , she had many favourites . Robert Dudley , Earl of Leicester was Elizabeth 's most important favourite during the first thirty years of her reign . He was most influential at court and one of the chief privy councillors . In 1585 - 1587 , he commanded the English army in the Netherlands , and was appointed Governor - General of the Netherlands in 1586 by the Dutch ( against Elizabeth 's wishes ) ; he gave up his post in December 1587 , and was appointed general of the armies to repel the Spanish invasion in 1588 , but died shortly after . Sir Christopher Hatton , another favourite , became captain of her bodyguard in 1572 , her spokesman in the House of Commons , and was made Lord Chancellor in 1587 despite little legal training , he was also an eminent privy councillor . Sir Walter Raleigh was such a favourite that he was showered with gifts , including the right to take possession of land in the New World , where he organised the exploration of what would be Virginia . Privy Council ( edit ) The Privy Council was Elizabeth 's group of advisers . Its main purpose was to give numerous different opinions and the monarch decided on the issue at hand . ( However , the advice was often ignored ; the Council still carried out her wishes . ) Routine administration was usually left to the Council . It was involved in matters of religion , military , the queen 's security , economics , and the welfare of the citizens . It dealt with both matters of national and individual interest , issued proclamations in the queen 's name , and supervised law and enforcement . The Council could make decisions , but the monarch could veto anything without question . Who was in it depended on who the queen wanted there . However , certain powerful noblemen were necessary in the Council so that their and their realms ' interests were represented so that a rebellion would be avoided . Believing that more members ( and therefore more different opinions ) would cause more problems , Elizabeth dropped the previous member count of 50 to 19 and eventually 11 by 1597 . The Counselors employed assistants who did most of the work . At first , they met only 3 times a week ; by the end of Elizabeth 's reign , they met almost every day . The Secretary of State led the Council . Sir William Cecil effectively led it ; he was wise , cautious , cooperative with Elizabeth , trusted above all others , Elizabeth 's personal secretary , and chief adviser until his death , and therefore very influential ; due to his great administrative ability , he had the reputation of one of the greatest English statesmen -- historians have even debated whether the success of Elizabeth 's rule was more due to Sir William Cecil or Elizabeth . His son was also a member of Queen Elizabeth 's Privy council . Parliament ( edit ) The group of representatives , called Parliament , was divided into the House of Lords ( or the Upper House ) , which consisted of nobility and higher clergy such as bishops and archbishops , and the House of Commons ( or the Lower House ) , which consisted of common people . Unlike the modern British Parliament , it had much less power , no Prime Minister or cabinet , and no political parties . The main function of Parliament was dealing with financial matters ( taxation and granting the queen money ) . Generally , the monarch paid for daily administration with ordinary revenues ( customs , feudal dues , and sales of land ) while Parliament covered extraordinary expenditures ( such as war ) with taxation . However , taxation did n't supply enough for military expenditures ; therefore , more land was sold along with probably illegal scheming . Parliament was also used for passing laws . 438 laws were passed under Elizabeth 's reign . They were either public , in which case they applied to all , or private , in which case they only applied to certain people . Only another Parliament could undo one . They required approval by both houses thrice and the queen . However , the queen could make Royal Proclamations without Parliament 's consent . Another purpose of Parliament was to advise . Nonetheless , Elizabeth was almost never interested in Parliament 's advice . Elections occurred only for the House of Commons . Who was in Parliament depended mainly on who was supported by the important local people . Only those that were male and received a certain annual income could vote . The monarch decided when Parliament was to be called . In total , Elizabeth only called Parliament thirteen times , 11 of which were to ask for money . Local governments ( edit ) Local governments were important in Tudor England . Royal representatives ( Justices of the Peace , Sheriffs , and Lords Lieutenant ) were appointed in every county ; they ensured that the queen 's commands and laws were obeyed . Regional governments helped oversee parts of England that the Privy Council could not supervise . The Council of the North , which resided in York , oversaw Northern England , while the Council of the Marches , which resided in Ludlow , oversaw Wales and some border counties . Manors were run by nobility and gentry . Land was power at the time ; those with land received payments from the tenants on their land and from their workers . Thus they had significant wealth and influence . They also had responsibilities , for they were meant to aid the monarch by governing their land . Local grievances were taken to the lord of the manor ; on the other hand , tenants were loyal to him -- if called upon , they were obliged to go to war . The lord 's views tended to greatly influence those of his largely uneducated tenants . Each city and town had its own government , headed by a mayor as well . Courts ( edit ) The courts made up the judicial system of Elizabethan England . The most important courts were the Great Sessions Courts or the Assizes , which were held twice a year in each county , and the Quarter Sessions Courts , which were held four times in a year . These two dealt with most crimes . The Assizes was famous for its power to inflict harsh punishments . Unimportant crimes were handled by the Petty Sessions Courts , Manor Courts , and town courts . Civil cases were dealt with by various courts , depending on the person 's monetary status ; the wealthy were tried by the Star Chamber , one of the highest profile courts which consisted of mostly Privy Counselors . The Court of Chancery also judged criminal cases , the Exchequer of Pleas dealt with financial suits , the Court of Requests with the poor ( `` the court of the poor man 's causes , '' as it was known ) , Church Courts with religious and moral cases , and other specific courts with other specific matters . Committers of high treason and other serious crimes received the death sentence ( often handled by the queen ) . Often a violent death sentence in the case of high treason involving being hanged , taken down before dead , dragged face downward through the streets , and then hacked into four pieces or quartered only to have the remains displayed in a public place to discourage others from committing treason . Those of lesser crimes were sent to prison or the stocks . Uses of the pillory , ducking stool , the Brank , The Drunkards Cloak , Burning , the Wheel and other forms of punishment and torture were also common during this time . Domestic policy ( edit ) This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( May 2013 ) A strict aristocracy helped Elizabeth maintain the dominance of her reign . She also has thousands of guards enforcing the city and the castle in case of any riots . If riots were to happen , there would be fireballs made of rock strewn and shot at the rioters . Foreign policy ( edit ) Elizabethan government concerning foreign policy is often accused of being affected by factionalism . This appears true in the later secion of her reign , post-Armada , when factions led by the Earl of Essex , and the Cecils , argued over which way the war against Spain should proceed . Essex , keen for glory and prestige , favored an expensive land based military strategy , whilst the Cecil faction advocated a cheaper moderate naval strategy . Due to the conflicting factions no policy was explicitly followed and each side frequently tried to undermine the others , resulting in a confused foreign policy . Faction pre-Armada is harder to analyze . The traditional view put forward by Read and Neale , suggests that William Cecil ( later Lord Burghley ) was continually in faction against Robert Dudley , over issues such as marriage and most importantly intervention in the Netherlands . Revisionist historian Adams defines faction as `` one group of people employed in direct opposition to another . '' It is on this premise that historians such as John Guy argue there was no true faction in the Council at this stage , disagreements were primarily over individual opinions , and judgements over how to proceed ; all councilors , after the removal of conservative Norfolk , were agreed that Elizabeth should look to further and protect the Protestant cause . Leicester and Walsingham saw intervention in the Netherlands as the best way to achieve this , whilst Cecil was more moderate . Impact ( edit ) The Elizabethan Era is famous for its playwrights ( William Shakespeare , Christopher Marlowe , and Ben Jonson ) that thrived during this period ; Francis Drake , the first Englishman to circumnavigate the world ; and Sir Walter Raleigh 's exploration of the New World . The stability and structure of the government helped to allow the arts to flourish and prompted other achievements in exploration . Sources ( edit ) ( Sharnette , Heather . `` PRIVY COUNCIL .

Please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations . ( March 2010 ) See also : Ministers to Elizabeth I England under Elizabeth I 's reign , the Elizabethan Era , was ruled by the very structured and complicated Elizabethan government . It was divided into the national bodies ( the monarch , Privy Council , and Parliament ) , the regional bodies ( the Council of the North and Council of the Marches ) , the county , community bodies and the court system . Elizabeth I had a very tough time gaining power , this was because her dad , Henry VIII , wanted a male heir so the family name would continue . When Henry finally got his male heir , Edward VI , he became the new successor . However when Henry died Edward was only 9 years old , and so he had advisers who ran the country for him . But at the age of 15 Edward dies , Mary I becomes the first female Queen , and takes the name of ' bloody Mary ' . She took this name because of all the protestants she executed for being of a different religion . When Mary dies , Elizabeth becomes Queen however that was n't the end of the hardship .

The government was very much a personal monarchy with ministers . The monarch 's personality determined the style , intensity , and efficiency . Back then , the monarch was a ruler , unlike the modern monarchs who are more like figureheads . The monarch was the ultimate decider and was able to determine issues of national religion , when Parliament would sit and what it would discuss , when and if the country would go to war , matters of education , welfare of the citizens , what food they could eat , and what clothes they could wear . She also had various counselors and officials to aid her rule. The queen could choose who would help her govern . The Divine Right of Kings gave the monarch the image of a Demigod . This strengthened authority made going against the monarch considered a sin . Not obeying the queen was considered treason and was punishable by death . The queen had the power to send one to prison and order executions . All laws required her consent to be passed . Generally , she could not pass laws herself -- she had to draw up a Bill and put it forward to Parliament . However , she could make Royal Proclamations without Parliament 's consent . Even with this much power , the monarch was not above the law , and she could be brought to court . Elizabeth is considered by many to be one of England 's best monarchs . She was wise and just , chose good advisers and was n't dominated by them , dealt with the stubbornly resistant Parliaments without being tyrannous , and was skilled at compromising in both religious and political matters . She ruled for 45 years and was the sixth and last of the Tudor dynasty . Sir William Cecil Sir William Cecil ( named Lord Burghley in 1571 ) was her chief adviser and supervised the whole administration . He was also Secretary of State from 1558 to 1572 and Lord Treasurer from 1572 to his death in 1598 .

In 1585 - 1587 , he commanded the English army in the Netherlands , and was appointed Governor - General of the Netherlands in 1586 by the Dutch ( against Elizabeth 's wishes ) ; he gave up his post in December 1587 , and was appointed general of the armies to repel the Spanish invasion in 1588 , but died shortly after . Sir Christopher Hatton , another favourite , became captain of her bodyguard in 1572 , her spokesman in the House of Commons , and was made Lord Chancellor in 1587 despite little legal training , he was also an eminent privy councillor . Sir Walter Raleigh was such a favourite that he was showered with gifts , including the right to take possession of land in the New World , where he organised the exploration of what would be Virginia . Privy Council The Privy Council was Elizabeth 's group of advisers . Its main purpose was to give numerous different opinions and the monarch decided on the issue at hand . ( However , the advice was often ignored ; the Council still carried out her wishes . ) Routine administration was usually left to the Council . It was involved in matters of religion , military , the queen 's security , economics , and the welfare of the citizens . It dealt with both matters of national and individual interest , issued proclamations in the queen 's name , and supervised law and enforcement . The Council could make decisions , but the monarch could veto anything without question . Who was in it depended on who the queen wanted there . However , certain powerful noblemen were necessary in the Council so that their and their realms ' interests were represented so that a rebellion would be avoided . Believing that more members ( and therefore more different opinions ) would cause more problems , Elizabeth dropped the previous member count of 50 to 19 and eventually 11 by 1597 . The Counselors employed assistants who did most of the work . At first , they met only 3 times a week ; by the end of Elizabeth 's reign , they met almost every day . The Secretary of State led the Council . Sir William Cecil effectively led it ; he was wise , cautious , cooperative with Elizabeth , trusted above all others , Elizabeth 's personal secretary , and chief adviser until his death , and therefore very influential ; due to his great administrative ability , he had the reputation of one of the greatest English statesmen -- historians have even debated whether the success of Elizabeth 's rule was more due to Sir William Cecil or Elizabeth . His son was also a member of Queen Elizabeth 's Privy council .

Unlike the modern British Parliament , it had much less power , no Prime Minister or cabinet , and no political parties . The main function of Parliament was dealing with financial matters ( taxation and granting the queen money ) . Generally , the monarch paid for daily administration with ordinary revenues ( customs , feudal dues , and sales of land ) while Parliament covered extraordinary expenditures ( such as war ) with taxation .

    "document": "Free agent - wikipedia Free agent For other uses , see Free agent ( disambiguation ) . In professional sports , a free agent is a player who is eligible to sign with any club or franchise ; i.e. , not under contract to any specific team . The term is also used in reference to a player who is under contract at present but who is allowed to solicit offers from other teams . In some circumstances , the free agent 's options are limited by league rules . Contents ( hide ) 1 Types 1.1 Terms 1.1. 1 Unrestricted free agent 1.1. 2 Restricted free agent 1.1. 3 Undrafted free agent 1.2 Legal provisions in Europe 2 Usage 2.1 Association football usage 2.2 Australian Football League usage 2.3 Major League Baseball ( MLB ) usage 2.4 National Basketball Association usage 2.5 National Football League usage 2.6 National Hockey League usage 3 Drawbacks for owners 4 Deadlines 5 References Types ( edit ) Terms ( edit ) Unrestricted free agent ( edit ) Unrestricted free agents are players without a team . They have either been released from their club , had the term of their contract expire without a renewal , or were not chosen in a league 's draft of amateur players . These people , generally speaking , are free to entertain offers from all other teams and to decide with whom to sign a contract . Restricted free agent ( edit ) Main article : Restricted free agent The specific rules of restricted free agency vary among the major professional sports , but in principle it means that a player is currently signed to one team but is free to solicit contract offers from other teams ; however , this player can not sign with the competing club if the current club matches ( or in some leagues , comes within 10 % of ) the terms of the offered contract . For a restricted free agent , some leagues require the competing team to offer to the original team one or more draft picks , when an offer is not matched , as compensation for losing the player . Undrafted free agent ( edit ) `` Undrafted '' redirects here . For the film , see Undrafted ( film ) . For the album , see Undrafted ( album ) . Players who are not drafted in a league 's annual draft of amateur players are considered to be unrestricted free agents and are free to sign contracts with any team . In most North American professional sports , players are drafted by sequencing each team from worst to best ( according to the teams ' immediately preceding season record , sometimes invoking a draft lottery factor to avoid having teams intentionally lose their last games to gain higher draft position ) and allowing said teams to claim rights to the top players entering the league that year . Players that pass through an entire draft ( usually several rounds ) without being selected by any of the league 's teams become unrestricted free agents , and these players are sometimes identified simply as an undrafted free agent ( UDFA ) or undrafted sportsperson and are free to sign with any team they choose . The term `` undrafted free agent '' is most common in the National Football League , where rookies enter directly into the NFL and do not play in a minor league system . It can also occasionally be seen in the National Hockey League , which increasingly uses college hockey as a source ; the NHL Entry Draft usually drafts players during high school age ( i.e. , junior leagues ) , which allows overlooked players who excel at the college level or in European professional leagues to bypass the draft and sign directly with the NHL . Legal provisions in Europe ( edit ) In the European Union , the 1995 Bosman ruling by the European Court of Justice established the right of free agency for association football players in all EU member nations . The Bosman ruling has since been extended to cover other professional sports and players from Eastern Europe . Players were still tied to their clubs unless their contract ran out until the Webster ruling allowed players the opportunity to move between nations , though it does not allow free players to move within the national league in which they currently play . Usage ( edit ) Association Football usage ( edit ) In professional association football , a free agent is either a player that has been released by a professional association football club and now is no longer affiliated with any club , or a player whose contract with his or her current club has expired and is thus free to join any other club under the terms of the Bosman ruling . Free agents do not have to be signed during the normal transfer window that is implemented in some countries ' leagues . If they are signed by a team , the team signing them does not have to pay any fees -- sometimes this is known as `` a free transfer '' . If a player is released from their club when the transfer window is closed , they can not sign for another team until the window reopens . A notable case of this being Sol Campbell who in September 2009 was released from Notts County , just after a month from signing on a free transfer . He signed for his former club Arsenal in January 2010 during the winter transfer window , after spending a few months training with the team to maintain his fitness . Australian Football League usage ( edit ) The Australian Football League introduced free agency at the end of 2012 . Out - of - contract players who are not within the top 25 % paid players at their club will become unrestricted free agents after eight seasons of service at one club ; out - of - contract players who are within the top 25 % paid players at their club become restricted free agents after eight seasons , then become unrestricted free agents after ten seasons . Clubs receive compensation in the form of draft picks for the loss of out - of - contract free agents . Players who are delisted will become unrestricted free agents , regardless of length of service ; clubs are not compensated for the transfer of such free agents . Major League Baseball ( MLB ) usage ( edit ) See also : Flood v. Kuhn Free Agency in the MLB came out of the aftermath of the Flood v. Kuhn Supreme Court case . One of the landmark decisions in the aftermath was the Messersmith / McNally Arbitration also known as the Seitz Decision which effectively destroyed the `` reserve clause '' in baseball . With the destruction of the reserve clause in baseball , the players and the league negotiated a new CBA in which was signed on July 12 , 1976 . It gave players a broader range of options as free agents . In Major League Baseball , free agents were previously classified as either Type A , Type B , or unclassified . Type A free agents were those determined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement to be in the top 20 % of all players based on the previous two seasons . Type B free agents were those in the next 20 % . Unclassified free agents were those in the bottom 60 % of players . Teams that lost a Type A free agent to whom they had offered arbitration received the top draft pick from the team that signed the free agent , plus a supplemental draft pick in the upcoming draft as compensation . Teams losing Type B free agents to whom they had offered arbitration received only a supplemental pick as compensation . Teams that have lost unclassified free agents , or who did not offer arbitration to classified free agents , did not receive any compensation . The current collective bargaining agreement between MLB and its players union , signed on November 22 , 2011 and taking effect with the 2012 season , dramatically changed free agent compensation . Players are no longer classified by type , and if a player has six or more years of major - league service ( on the team 's 40 - man roster ) and not under contract for the following season is automatically a free agent . They can offer them an arbitration salary if they want to be able to receive draft pick compensation . The offer must be at least equal to the average of the 125 richest contracts . However , if a player is traded during the final season of his contract , his new team will be ineligible to receive any draft pick compensation . There are more rules than just compensation rules that are included in MLB free agency . One of those rules is that National Basketball Association usage ( edit ) Main article : NBA salary cap § Free agency National Football League usage ( edit ) Exclusive - rights free agents Exclusive - rights free agents ( ERFAs ) are players with two or fewer seasons of service time and whose contracts have expired . If their team tenders a qualifying offer ( a one - year contract usually at league - minimum salary ) the player has no negotiating rights with other teams , and must either sign the tender with the team or sit out the season . Restricted free agents Restricted free agents ( RFAs ) are players who have three accrued seasons of service and whose contracts have expired . RFAs have received qualifying offers from their old clubs and are free to negotiate with any club until a deadline which occurs approximately a week prior to the NFL Draft ( for 2010 the deadline was April 15 ) , at which time their rights revert to their original club . If a player accepts an offer from a new club , the old club will have the right to match the offer and retain the player . If the old club elects not to match the offer , it may receive draft - choice compensation depending on the level of the qualifying offer made to the player . Unrestricted free agents Unrestricted free agents are players with expired contracts that have completed four or more accrued seasons of service . They are free to sign with any franchise . Undrafted free agents Undrafted free agents are players eligible for the NFL Draft but who are not selected ; they can negotiate and sign with any team . `` Plan B '' free agency Plan B free agency was a type of free agency that became active in the National Football League in February 1989 to 1992 . Plan B free agency permitted all teams in the NFL to preserve limited rights of no more than 37 total players a season ; if a player was a protected Plan B free agent , he was incapable of signing with another team without providing his old team the first opportunity to sign him again . The rest of the players were left unprotected , liberated to negotiate contracts with the rest of the teams in the league . Eight players sued the NFL in U.S. federal court , stating that Plan B was an unlawful restraint of trade . In 1992 , a jury found that Plan B violated antitrust laws and awarded damages to these players . National Hockey League usage ( edit ) In the NHL , between 2005 and 2008 , the age of unrestricted free agency declined from 31 to 27 . As of 2008 , any player who is at least 27 years old or has at least seven years of service as an NHL player , and whose contract has expired , will become an unrestricted free agent . On July 1 of each year the free agency period begins , and unrestricted free agents are free to negotiate and sign contracts with any team . Under the old collective agreement , which expired in 2004 , draft picks were awarded as compensation when a team lost an unrestricted free agent ; however , under the current CBA teams losing unrestricted free agents do not receive any compensation . In addition , any player at least 22 years of age who has not been selected in the NHL Draft can sign with any team as a free agent . Any player who is not entry - level , but does not meet the qualifications of unrestricted free agency becomes a restricted free agent when his contract expires . Drawbacks for owners ( edit ) The economics of free agency are disadvantageous for team owners ; it can lead to bidding wars -- and increased player salaries mean decreased owner profits . Restrictions on free agency have therefore been preferred by North American team owners since the abolition of the reserve clause . For example , a draft can be used to keep young and talented players from generating bidding wars and causing higher player salaries throughout the league . Furthermore , some teams which play in large market cities , and hence have a larger revenue stream , would be able to outbid other teams for talented players . Some leagues , such as the National Football League and the National Basketball Association have imposed salary cap rules in order to avert such bidding wars ( the NFL itself was created in an effort to prevent bidding wars that had crippled preceding regional leagues like the Ohio League and Pittsburgh circuit ) . In Europe , the wages of the top players have increased dramatically since the Bosman ruling , although this is partly because of increased television revenues . As in North America , the number of transfers involving a fee are on the decline since clubs can wait for players to finish their contracts and become unrestricted . Also in Major League Baseball the larger and more successful teams often trump the lesser income teams from lack of a salary cap . Deadlines ( edit ) In some leagues , free agency has deadlines . For example , under the most recent NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement , restricted free agents who do not sign contracts by December 1 of a given year will be ineligible to play in the National Hockey League for the balance of that season . However , other leagues ( such as the National Basketball Association ) have no such restrictions . In Europe , players can only move during transfer windows -- during the close season and halfway through the league season . There are exceptions for unsigned professional players in the lower divisions . References ( edit ) Jump up ^ `` Free agency rules '' . Australian Football League . 16 March 2012 .

Undrafted free agent `` Undrafted '' redirects here . For the film , see Undrafted ( film ) . For the album , see Undrafted ( album ) . Players who are not drafted in a league 's annual draft of amateur players are considered to be unrestricted free agents and are free to sign contracts with any team . In most North American professional sports , players are drafted by sequencing each team from worst to best ( according to the teams ' immediately preceding season record , sometimes invoking a draft lottery factor to avoid having teams intentionally lose their last games to gain higher draft position ) and allowing said teams to claim rights to the top players entering the league that year . Players that pass through an entire draft ( usually several rounds ) without being selected by any of the league 's teams become unrestricted free agents , and these players are sometimes identified simply as an undrafted free agent ( UDFA ) or undrafted sportsperson and are free to sign with any team they choose . The term `` undrafted free agent '' is most common in the National Football League , where rookies enter directly into the NFL and do not play in a minor league system . It can also occasionally be seen in the National Hockey League , which increasingly uses college hockey as a source ; the NHL Entry Draft usually drafts players during high school age ( i.e. , junior leagues ) , which allows overlooked players who excel at the college level or in European professional leagues to bypass the draft and sign directly with the NHL . Legal provisions in Europe In the European Union , the 1995 Bosman ruling by the European Court of Justice established the right of free agency for association football players in all EU member nations .

        "rag_answer": "Yes, other leagues have similar concepts to undrafted free agents (UDFAs). While the term \"undrafted free agent\" is most common in the NFL, the concept exists in other leagues as well. For example, the National Hockey League (NHL) also has undrafted players who can sign directly with teams, especially those who excel in college hockey or European professional leagues and bypass the draft. In general, players who are not selected in a league's draft become unrestricted free agents and are free to sign with any team they choose. Additionally, the concept of free agency, including unrestricted and restricted free agents, exists across many professional sports leagues such as the NBA, MLB, and European association football leagues, with some variations in rules and legal provisions.",

There are more rules than just compensation rules that are included in MLB free agency . One of those rules is that National Basketball Association usage Main article : NBA salary cap § Free agency National Football League usage Exclusive - rights free agents Exclusive - rights free agents ( ERFAs ) are players with two or fewer seasons of service time and whose contracts have expired . If their team tenders a qualifying offer ( a one - year contract usually at league - minimum salary ) the player has no negotiating rights with other teams , and must either sign the tender with the team or sit out the season . Restricted free agents Restricted free agents ( RFAs ) are players who have three accrued seasons of service and whose contracts have expired . RFAs have received qualifying offers from their old clubs and are free to negotiate with any club until a deadline which occurs approximately a week prior to the NFL Draft ( for 2010 the deadline was April 15 ) , at which time their rights revert to their original club . If a player accepts an offer from a new club , the old club will have the right to match the offer and retain the player . If the old club elects not to match the offer , it may receive draft - choice compensation depending on the level of the qualifying offer made to the player . Unrestricted free agents Unrestricted free agents are players with expired contracts that have completed four or more accrued seasons of service . They are free to sign with any franchise . Undrafted free agents Undrafted free agents are players eligible for the NFL Draft but who are not selected ; they can negotiate and sign with any team . `` Plan B '' free agency Plan B free agency was a type of free agency that became active in the National Football League in February 1989 to 1992 . Plan B free agency permitted all teams in the NFL to preserve limited rights of no more than 37 total players a season ; if a player was a protected Plan B free agent , he was incapable of signing with another team without providing his old team the first opportunity to sign him again . The rest of the players were left unprotected , liberated to negotiate contracts with the rest of the teams in the league . Eight players sued the NFL in U.S. federal court , stating that Plan B was an unlawful restraint of trade . In 1992 , a jury found that Plan B violated antitrust laws and awarded damages to these players . National Hockey League usage In the NHL , between 2005 and 2008 , the age of unrestricted free agency declined from 31 to 27 . As of 2008 , any player who is at least 27 years old or has at least seven years of service as an NHL player , and whose contract has expired , will become an unrestricted free agent . On July 1 of each year the free agency period begins , and unrestricted free agents are free to negotiate and sign contracts with any team . Under the old collective agreement , which expired in 2004 , draft picks were awarded as compensation when a team lost an unrestricted free agent ; however , under the current CBA teams losing unrestricted free agents do not receive any compensation . In addition , any player at least 22 years of age who has not been selected in the NHL Draft can sign with any team as a free agent . Any player who is not entry - level , but does not meet the qualifications of unrestricted free agency becomes a restricted free agent when his contract expires .

The Cedar River takes its name from the red cedar ( Juniperus virginiana ) trees growing there , and was originally called the Red Cedar River by the Meskwaki . The first Mississippi steamboat reached Cedar Rapids , Iowa in 1844 , and during the next decade , the Red Cedar ( as it was still called ) was an important commercial waterway .

    "document": "David Hale ( Sons of Anarchy ) - wikipedia David Hale ( Sons of Anarchy ) Jump to : navigation , search David Hale First appearance `` Pilot '' ( episode 1.01 ) ( 2008 ) Last appearance `` So '' ( episode 3.01 ) ( 2010 ) Created by Kurt Sutter Portrayed by Taylor Sheridan Information Nickname ( s ) Captain America , Dave , Davy Gender Male Occupation Deputy Chief of the Charming Police Department Title Deputy Chief Family Jacob Hale ( father ) Jacob Hale Jr. ( brother ) Deputy Chief David Hale is a fictional character on the FX television series Sons of Anarchy , played by Taylor Sheridan . He was the Deputy Chief of Police in the small Northern Californian town of Charming . The Chief , Wayne Unser , nicknamed him `` Captain America '' for his black and white views , and squeaky - clean adherence to the law , and possibly because of his square jawed all - American looks . Contents ( hide ) 1 Biography 1.1 First season 1.2 Second season 1.3 Third season 2 References Biography ( edit ) Hale is a native of Charming , California , and his father , Jacob , was a county judge and a very powerful and wealthy man . He also has an older brother , Jacob , Jr . As a boy , he delivered newspapers to the town 's infamous Teller household . He was a childhood friend of Jax Teller , Tara Knowles and Opie Winston , until they graduated from high school . Hale enlisted in the American Marine Corps . After his honorable discharge , he went on to become a police officer at the local police department and is now Deputy Chief , next in line for the Chief job once Wayne Unser retires . Unlike Unser , Hale wishes to purge the town of SAMCRO ( the local biker gang , run by the Tellers ) upon becoming Chief of Police . Like him , his father and brother also want to see SAMCRO leave Charming , but , unlike him , their desire is motivated by their wish to profit financially from the gang 's absence , something which appears to irritate David . Because of Hale 's attitude , SAMCRO leader Clay Morrow convinced Unser to continue on as police Chief in order to ensure Hale does n't assume the position and become a threat to SAMCRO and their allies . He serves as an antagonist to SAMCRO during the first season , but became less hostile during Season Two . First season ( edit ) After learning that Unser is staying on , Hale calls in the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives to see if they can circumvent Unser . He soon became sexually involved with Agent June Stahl , which is against department regulations . One of their encounters was witnessed by Jax Teller while he was breaking Cherry out of the County Jail . The two lovers fell out , however , over Stahl 's decision to delude SAMCRO into believing that Opie Winston was an informant and her locking Hale out of the investigation . When Stahl removed Opie 's protective detail , Hale ( after much convincing from Unser ) decided to inform the SAMCRO that Opie was not a `` rat . '' The information came too late to prevent the murder of Opie 's wife , Donna . At the crime scene , Hale icily informed Stahl , `` This blood 's on you . '' Second season ( edit ) At the start of Season Two , Hale is introduced to Ethan Zobelle by his older brother , Jacob , in the hopes of getting SAMCRO out of Charming . Zobelle leads the White separatist group , the League of American Nationals ( L.O.A.N. ) . David , aware of L.O.A.N. 's racial beliefs , initially refused Zobelle 's help ( Jacob , a businessman who hopes to profit from SAMCRO 's absence in Charming , is not concerned with L.O.A.N. 's beliefs or methods ) . However , David is so determined to rid Charming of SAMCRO that he begins to accept Zobelle 's assistance ( or , at least , turns a blind eye towards L.O.A.N. 's activities ) even though he knows that they use more violent tactics than the Sons . L.O.A.N. 's first illegal action was giving Darby and the Nords the backing to operate a meth lab in Charming . SAMCRO discovered that the Nords were dealing meth in Charming and tipped off Hale , who then visited the property where the meth lab was located . Although Hale threatened Darby that he would get a warrant to search the property , but instead he told Unser that he investigated SAMCRO 's tip and that there was no meth lab . SAMCRO , now feeling that Hale had fallen in with Zobelle 's group , took the matter into their own hands and destroyed the lab themselves . Zobelle then tried to force Hale into taking action against SAMCRO by providing surveillance footage of Opie blowing up the meth lab that Hale allowed to operate . At the same time , Hale is also given footage of himself apparently taking a bribe from Darby ( actually just a gift certificate to Zobelle 's Impeccable Smokes shop opening ) . After being reprimanded by Unser for collaborating with Zobelle , being informed by Unser about what Zobelle 's people did to Gemma , and being told he needs to be the `` clean one '' , Hale gave Clay and Jax information they needed to sink a real estate scam run by Jacob Hale and let them know that Zobelle was surveiling them . Hale also told them that he was n't Unser and was n't on anyone 's payroll . Throughout season two , Hale started to show some signs of cooperation with SAMCRO , realizing that L.O.A.N. was more of threat to Charming than SAMCRO . He began to understand Unser 's behavior , realizing that the elderly chief did n't have much of a choice anymore in whether or not to deal with Clay Morrow and the Sons . In the episode `` The Culling , '' Unser informs Hale that he will be the new acting chief ( possibly signifying Unser 's retirement in the near future ) . In the second - season finale , perhaps adopting some of Unser 's attitude , Hale appeared unconcerned with what SAMCRO did to A.J. Weston and Ethan Zobelle as long as it was not done in Charming . Ethan Zobelle , cornered in a deli outside of Charming by SAMCRO , called Hale for help . Hale lied and told Zobelle that the sheriffs were on the way , but after hanging up he made no effort to inform the local sheriffs . He was last seen consoling a distraught Tara Knowles over the kidnapping of Abel Teller . Third season ( edit ) In the season premiere , Hale is first seen moving into the office of the chief , a position that he states will soon be official . His brother , Jacob , apologizes for bringing Zobelle to Charming , and states that he never intended things to escalate as far as they did . Jacob also tells Hale that he is continuing with his campaign to be mayor of Charming , and asks for `` the support of the chief . '' Hale agrees to support his brother . Later in the episode , Hale keeps vigil over Half - Sack 's funeral which is being attended by numerous Sons Of Anarchy members and associates . Jacob meets him there and reiterates his disgust for the gang and the apparent outpouring of support for them . Hale explains that people , including those in Charming , do n't like to see SAMCRO vulnerable since it makes everyone uncomfortable . Later into the funeral , an unknown party , later revealed to be the Calaveras MC , commits a drive - by shooting , injuring and killing several attendees . Hale tries to stop them by getting in front of their van and firing at the driver , but is killed when the vehicle runs him over . Jacob and Unser both futilely rush towards his bloodied body as the van speeds off . In an interview , series creator and executive producer , Kurt Sutter , explained that the decision to kill Hale in the season premiere was motivated by Sheridan 's desire to move on to another project .

    "document": "Age of marriage in the United states - wikipedia Age of marriage in the United states General age of marriage ( without parental or court approval or other exceptions taken into account ) 18 19 21 Unlike most Western countries , 18 of the U.S. states do not have a legal minimum age of marriage . Individuals aged 18 have the ability to marry in U.S. states except Nebraska ( 19 ) and Mississippi ( 21 ) . In addition , all states , except Delaware and New Jersey , allow minors to marry in certain circumstances , such as parental consent , judicial consent , pregnancy , or a combination of these situations . Most states allow parties aged 16 and 17 to marry with parental consent alone . In most states , children under 16 can be married too . In the 32 states which have an absolute minimum age set by statute , this age varies between 14 and 18 , while in 18 states there is no statutory minimum age if other legal conditions are met . Although in such states there is no set minimum age by statute , the traditional common law minimum age is 14 for boys and 12 for girls - ages which have been confirmed by case law in some states . Over the past 15 years , more than 200,000 minors married in US , and in Tennessee girls as young as 10 were married in 2001 , before the state finally set a minimum age of 17 in 2018 . State / Territory Minimum age Notes Statutory age when all exceptions are taken into account General age Alabama 16 18 Alaska 14 18 Arizona 16 18 Since 2018 , the minimum age with approval of a superior court judge and parental consent is 16 . Arkansas none 18 California none 18 No minimum age with approval of a superior court judge and parental consent . Colorado none 18 No minimum age with judicial approval and parental consent . Connecticut 16 18 Since 2017 , the minimum age is 16 with parental and judicial consent . Delaware 18 18 Since May 2018 , the Delaware child marriage ban bill was signed into law and went into effect immediately to implement a clear minimum age of 18 with no exceptions . District of Columbia 16 18 Florida 17 18 Since July 1 , 2018 17 - year - olds need both parental and judicial approval and may not marry anyone more than 2 years older . Georgia 16 18 Hawaii 15 18 15 with parental or judicial consent . Idaho none 18 Illinois 16 18 Indiana 15 18 15 in the case of pregnancy with both parental and judicial consent . Iowa 16 18 Kansas 15 18 Kentucky 17 18 Since 2018 , 17 - year - olds need judicial approval . Louisiana none 18 Maine none 18 Maryland 15 18 Massachusetts none 18 Consent can be just judicial , but is normally both parental and judicial . In the absence of any statutory minimum age , one opinion is that the traditional minimum common law marriageable age of 12 for girls and 14 for boys may still be in effect . Michigan none 18 16 with parental consent Minnesota 16 18 Mississippi none 21 females 15 -- 21 and males 17 -- 21 can marry with parental consent alone Missouri 16 18 In July 2018 a bill was signed into law by the Governor of Missouri , to implement an absolute minimum age of 16 and to ban people over 21 years old marrying people under the age of 18 . The law went into effect on August 28 , 2018 . Montana 16 18 Nebraska 17 19 Nevada none 18 New Hampshire 16 ( in effect from January 1 , 2019 ) 18 In 2018 , the minimum age was set at 16 ( in effect from 1 January , 2019 ) .

New Mexico none 18 New York 17 18 Since 2017 , the minimum age is 17 with parental and judicial consent . North Carolina 14 18 North Dakota 16 18 16 with parental consent . Ohio none 18 18 for males regardless of parental consent . 16 for females with parental consent , 18 for females without parental consent . Oklahoma none 18 Oregon 17 18 Consenting parent or guardian must accompany the applicant when applying for the marriage license .

Rhode Island none 18 South Carolina 16 / none ( conflicting laws ) 18 The age is 16 , with parental consent , but there is controversy regarding the interpretation of the law , which some judges consider to allow marriage without an age limit in case of pregnancy . South Dakota 16 18 Tennessee 17 18 In 2018 , the minimum age was set to 17 and no minor can marry someone more than 4 years older . Texas 16 18 Since 2017 , the minimum age is 18 , however emancipated minors aged 16 -- 17 have an exemption to legally marry . Utah 15 18 15 with court approval and parental consent . Vermont 16 18 Virginia 16 18 In 2016 , VA made 18 the minimum age ; and 16 with court approval in special cases Washington none 18 May be waived by superior court judge .

    "document": "Out of left field - wikipedia Out of left field Jump to : navigation , search This article is about an American slang term . For the Hank Williams Jr album , see Out of Left Field . `` Out of left field '' is American slang meaning `` unexpectedly '' , `` odd '' or `` strange '' . The phrase came from baseball terminology referring to the area covered by the left fielder who has the farthest throw to first base . According to mlb.com there is another meaning : `` The term ' way out in left field ' is taken to mean ' crazy . ' '' Cook County Hospital ( by the West Side Grounds , the Chicago Cubs first location under what is now the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine ) had a mental institution behind left field , ( This can not be true . Left field was against Wood St . ) ( ... ) The bottom line is , patients could be heard yelling and screaming things at fans behind the left field wall . ' '' Variations include `` out in left field '' and simply `` left field '' . Music industry ( edit ) Popular music historian Arnold Shaw wrote in 1949 for the Music Library Association that the term `` out of left field '' was first used in the idiomatic sense of `` from out of nowhere '' by the music industry to refer to a song that unexpectedly performed well in the market . Based on baseball lingo , a sentence such as `` That was a hit out of left field '' was used by song pluggers who promoted recordings and sheet music , to describe a song requiring no effort to sell . A `` rocking chair hit '' was the kind of song which came `` out of left field '' and sold itself , allowing the song plugger to relax . A 1943 article in Billboard magazine expands the use to describe people unexpectedly drawn to radio broadcasting : `` Latest twist in radio linked with the war is the exceptional number of quasi-clerical groups and individuals who have come out of left field in recent months and are trying to buy , not promote , radio time . '' Further instances of the phrase were published in the 1940s , including more times in Billboard magazine and once in a humor book titled How to Be Poor . Later explanations ( edit ) In May 1981 , columnist William Safire asked readers of The New York Times to send him any ideas they had regarding the origin of the phrase `` out of left field '' -- he did not know where it came from , and did not refer to Shaw 's work . On June 28 , 1981 , he devoted most of his Sunday column to the phrase , offering up various responses he received . The earliest scholarly citation Safire could find was a 1961 article in the journal American Speech , which defined the variation `` out in left field '' as meaning `` disoriented , out of contact with reality . '' Linguist John Algeo told Safire that the phrase most likely came from baseball observers rather than from baseball fans or players . In Safire 's Political Dictionary , Safire writes that the phrase `` out of left field '' means `` out of the ordinary , out of touch , far out . '' The variation `` out in left field '' means alternately `` removed from the ordinary , unconventional '' or `` out of contact with reality , out of touch . '' He compares the term to left - wing politics and the Left Coast -- slang for the liberal - leaning coastal cities in California , Oregon and Washington . In 1998 , American English professor Robert L. Chapman , in his book American Slang , wrote that the phrase `` out of left field '' was in use by 1953 . He did not cite Shaw 's work and he did not point to printed instances of the phrase in the 1940s . Marcus Callies , an associate professor of English and philology at the University of Mainz in Germany , wrote that `` the precise origin is unclear and disputed '' , referring to Christine Ammer 's conclusion in The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms . Callies suggested that the left fielder in baseball might throw the ball to home plate in an effort to get the runner out before he scores , and that the ball , coming from behind the runner out of left field , would surprise the runner . From the Way Out In Left Field Society : `` The phrase `` way out in left field '' has evolved to mean an eccentric , odd , misguided or peculiar statement or act . Although the origin of the phrase has been challenged and debated over the years , the most logical and realistic explanation comes from an extinct baseball park called West Side Grounds that the Chicago Cubs called home from 1893 to 1915 . As legend has it , a mental hospital called the Neuropsychiatric Institute was located directly behind the left field wall . The Institute housed mental patients who could be heard making strange and bizarre comments within listening distance of players and fans . Thus , if someone said that you were `` way out in left field , '' the person was questioning your sanity and comparing you with a mental patient '' References ( edit ) Jump up ^ http://m.mlb.com/news/article/2954187/ Jump up ^ Partridge , Eric ; Dalzell , Tom ; Victor , Terry ( 2007 ) .

Instead, the phrase appears to have been popularized gradually through its use in various industries around that time, such as the music industry (where it referred to unexpectedly successful songs) and the radio broadcasting industry (describing unexpected entrants). Multiple published instances in magazines like Billboard and other sources throughout the 1940s helped spread the phrase idiomatically. Therefore, no particular event is identified as the catalyst for its increased usage; rather, it was a more gradual adoption across different fields.",

MLS initially adopted a traditional all - star game format used by other North American sports leagues where the Eastern Conference squared off against the Western Conference . This eventually evolved into the current system where the league annually invites a club from abroad to play against a league all - star team . The MLS All - Stars hold an 8 -- 4 record in the competition marking the season 's midpoint . Players are awarded rosters spots through a combination of fan voting and selections by the appointed manager and league commissioner . In case of a tie after full - time , the game does not use a 30 - minute extra time period ; instead it goes straight to a penalty shoot - out .

You can help by adding to it . ( March 2012 ) Major League Soccer 's first all - star game was played at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1996 . The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI . Roster ( edit ) For 2014 , ten players were chosen by All - Star Game coach Caleb Porter , eleven players were chosen by fan voting ( subject to Porter 's approval ) , and two were selected by MLS commissioner Don Garber .

( January 2008 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Sun 's seasonal declination differences , viewed from some northern mid-latitude Sun path polar chart for any location at the latitude of Rotterdam Sun path , sometimes also called day arc , refers to the daily and seasonal arc - like path that the Sun appears to follow across the sky as the Earth rotates and orbits the Sun . The Sun 's path affects the length of daytime experienced and amount of daylight received along a certain latitude during a given season . The relative position of the Sun is a major factor in the heat gain of buildings and in the performance of solar energy systems . Accurate location - specific knowledge of sun path and climatic conditions is essential for economic decisions about solar collector area , orientation , landscaping , summer shading , and the cost - effective use of solar trackers . Contents ( hide ) 1 Effect of the Earth 's axial tilt 1.1 Shadow of Vertical Stick at Solar Noon 1.2 Duration of Daylight 2 Building design simulation 3 Visualization 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Effect of the Earth 's axial tilt ( edit ) This section is too long . Consider splitting it into new pages , adding subheadings , or condensing it . ( June 2017 ) Sun paths at any latitude and any time of the year can be determined from basic geometry . The Earth 's axis of rotation tilts about 23.5 degrees , relative to the plane of Earth 's orbit around the Sun . As the Earth orbits the Sun , this creates the 47 ° declination difference between the solstice sun paths , as well as the hemisphere - specific difference between summer and winter . In the Northern Hemisphere , the sun path near to the winter solstice ( November , December , January ) rises in the southeast , transits the celestial meridian at a low angle in the south ( more than 43 ° above the southern horizon in the tropics ) , and then sets in the southwest . It is on the south ( equator ) side of the house all day long . A vertical window facing south ( equator side ) is effective for capturing solar thermal energy . For comparison , the sun path near the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere ( May , June , July ) rises in the northeast , peaks out at a low angle in the north ( more than halfway up from the horizon in the tropics ) , and then sets in the northwest . There , the north - facing window would let in plenty of solar thermal energy to the house . In the Northern Hemisphere , the sun path near to the summer solstice ( May , June , July ) , the Sun rises in the northeast , peaks out slightly south of overhead point ( lower in the south at higher latitude ) , and then sets in the northwest , whereas in the Southern Hemisphere the sun path near the summer solstice ( November , December , January ) , the Sun rises in the southeast , peaks out slightly north of overhead point ( lower in the north at higher latitude ) , and then sets in the southwest . A simple latitude - dependent equator - side overhang can easily be designed to block 100 % of the direct solar gain from entering vertical equator - facing windows on the hottest days of the year . Roll - down exterior shade screens , interior translucent - or - opaque window quilts , drapes , shutters , movable trellises , etc. can be used for hourly , daily or seasonal sun and heat transfer control ( without any active electrical air conditioning ) . Everywhere around the world during the equinoxes ( March 20 / 21 and September 22 / 23 ) except for the poles , the sun rises due east and sets due west . In the Northern Hemisphere , the equinox sun peaks in the southern half ( about halfway up from the horizon at mid latitude ) of the sky , while in the Southern Hemisphere , that sun peaks in the northern half of the sky . When facing the equator , the sun appears to move from left to right in the Northern Hemisphere and from right to left in the Southern Hemisphere . The latitude ( and hemisphere ) - specific solar path differences are critical to effective passive solar building design . They are essential data for optimal window and overhang seasonal design . Solar designers must know the precise solar path angles for each location they design for , and how they compare to place - based seasonal heating and cooling requirements . In the U.S. , the precise location - specific altitude - and - azimuth seasonal solar path numbers are available from NOAA -- the `` equator side '' of a building is south in the Northern Hemisphere , and north in the Southern Hemisphere , where the peak summer solstice solar altitude occurs on December 21 . Shadow of vertical stick at solar noon ( edit ) On the equator , the sun will be straight overhead and a vertical stick will cast no shadow at solar noon on the equinoxes . On the vernal equinox , north of the subsolar point ( on the equator ) the vertical stick 's shadow will point a little westwards of true north ( NNW ) reading 336.5 ° from true north and little eastwards of true south ( SSE ) reading 156.5 ° from true north . On the autumnal equinox , north of the subsolar point ( on the equator ) , the shadow will point a little eastwards of true north ( NNE ) reading 23.5 ° from true north ( and south of the subsolar , the shadow will point a little westward of true south ( SSW ) reading 203.5 ° from true north ) . The same stick will cast no shadow on the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere when the subsolar point is on the Tropic of Cancer 23.44 ° north of equator . Although north of 23.44 ° N the shadow will point towards true north and south of 23.44 ° N the shadow will point towards true south . The reverse occurs on the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere when the subsolar point will be on the Tropic of Capricorn 23.44 ° S and a vertical stick will cast no shadow along that point . But north of the Tropic of Capricorn solar noon shadows will point towards true north and south of the Tropic of Capricorn shadows will point towards true south . The solar noon shadows of objects on points beyond and below subsolar points will point towards true north and true south respectively only when the solar declination has its maximum positive ( δ ☉ = + 23.44 ° ) or maximum negative ( δ ☉ = − 23.44 ° ) value . On the other hand , on the equinoxes when the sun is neither declined north nor south ( δ ☉ = 0 ° ) and solar time noon shadows point NNW north of the equator and SSE south of the equator on the vernal equinox ( and point NNE north of the equator and SSW south of the equator on the autumnal equinox ) . Duration of daylight ( edit ) North of the Arctic circle and south of the Antarctic circle , there will be at least one day a year when the sun is not above the horizon for 24 hours during the winter solstice , and at least one day when the sun is above the horizon for 24 hours during the summer solstice . In the moderate latitudes ( between the circles and tropics , where most humans live ) , the length of the day , solar altitude and azimuth vary from one day to the next , and from season to season . The difference between the length of a long summer day and a short winter day increases as one moves farther away from the equator .

( September 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Before the days of modern , inexpensive , 3D computer graphics , a heliodon ( precisely - movable light source ) was used to show the angle of the sun on a physical model of a proposed building . Today , mathematical computer models calculate location - specific solar gain ( shading ) and seasonal thermal performance , with the ability to rotate and animate a 3D color graphic model of a proposed building design . Heating and cooling issues in passive solar building design can be counterintuitive . Precise performance calculations and simulations are essential to avoid reinventing the wheel and duplicating expensive experimental design errors , such as skylights that turn a building into a solar furnace in summer ( see Daylighting # Sawtooth roof ) . Visualization ( edit ) These pictures show such a perspective as follows . They show the day arcs of the Sun , the paths the Sun tracks along the celestial dome in its diurnal movement . The pictures show this for every hour on both solstice days . The longer arc is always the summer track and the shorter one the winter track . The two tracks are at a distance of 46.88 ° ( 2 × 23.44 ° ) away from each other . In addition , some `` ghost '' suns are indicated below the horizon , as much as 18 ° down . The Sun in this area causes twilight . The pictures can be used for both the northern and southern hemispheres . The observer is supposed to sit near the tree on the island in the middle of the ocean . The green arrows give the cardinal directions . On the northern hemisphere the north is to the left , the Sun rises in the east ( far arrow ) , culminates in the south ( to the right ) while moving to the right and sets in the west ( near arrow ) . Both rise and set positions are displaced towards the north in summer , and towards the south for the winter track . On the southern hemisphere the south is to the left , the Sun rises in the east ( near arrow ) , culminates in the north ( to the right ) while moving to the left and sets in the west ( far arrow ) . Both rise and set positions are displaced towards the south in summer , and towards the north for the winter track . The following special cases are depicted . On the imaginary line of the equator the Sun maximum elevation is great during all the year but it does n't form every day a perfect right angle with the ground at noon . In fact it happens two days of the year , during the equinoxes . The solstices are the dates that the Sun stays farthest away from the zenith but anyway also in those cases it 's high in the sky , reaching an altitude of 66.56 ° either to the north or the south . All days of the year , solstices included , have the same length of 12 hours . The day arcs at 20 ° latitude . The Sun culminates at 46.56 ° altitude in winter and 93.44 ° altitude in summer . In this case an angle larger than 90 ° means that the culmination takes place at an altitude of 86.56 ° in the opposite cardinal direction . For example , in the southern hemisphere , the Sun remains in the north during winter , but can reach over the zenith to the south in midsummer . Summer days are longer than winter days , but approximately the difference is no more than only two and a half hours . The daily path of the Sun is steep at the horizon the whole year round , resulting in a twilight of only about one hour and 20 minutes in the morning and in the evening . The day arcs at 50 ° latitude . During the winter solstice Sun does not rise more than 16.56 ° above the horizon at midday , but 63.44 ° in summer solstice above the same horizon direction . The difference in the length of the day between summer and winter , from here to the north , begin to be striking -- slightly more than 8 hours at winter solstice , to more than 16 hours during the summer solstice . Likewise is the difference in direction of sunrise and sunset . At this latitude at midnight ( around 1 a.m. with summer legal hour ) the summer sun is 16.56 ° below the horizon , which means that astronomical twilight continues the whole night . This phenomenon is known as the grey nights , nights when it does not get dark enough for astronomers to do their observations of the deep sky . Above 60 ° latitude the Sun would be even closer to the horizon , only 6.56 ° away from it . Then civil twilight continues almost all night , only a little bit of `` nautical twilight '' obviously around the local midnight . And above 66.56 ° latitude , there is no sunset at all , a phenomenon referred to as the midnight sun . The day arcs at 70 ° latitude . At local noon the winter Sun culminates at − 3.44 ° , and the summer Sun at 43.44 °. Said another way , during the winter the Sun does not rise above the horizon , it is the polar night . There will be still a strong twilight though . At local midnight the summer Sun culminates at 3.44 ° , said another way , it does not set , it is the polar day . The day arcs at the pole . At the time of the summer or winter solstices , the Sun is 23.44 ° degrees above or below the horizon respectively , irrespective of time of day . Whilst the Sun is up ( during summer months ) it will circle around the whole sky ( clockwise from the North Pole and counter-clockwise from the South Pole ) , appearing to stay at the same angle from the horizon , therefore the concept of day or night is meaningless . The angle of elevation will gradually change on an annual cycle , with the Sun reaching its highest point at the summer solstice , and rising or setting at the equinox , with extended periods of twilight lasting several days after the autumn equinox and before the spring equinox . Day arcs at 0 ° latitude , equator . Day arcs at 20 ° latitude . Day arcs at 50 ° latitude . Day arcs at 70 ° latitude . Day arcs at 90 ° latitude , pole .

        "type": "Follow-up",
        "rag_answer": "As you move further from the equator toward higher latitudes, the sun's path and the duration of daylight undergo significant changes:\n\n1. Increased Variation in Daylight Duration: \n- Near the equator (0° latitude), day and night durations are nearly equal throughout the year, with the sun rising and setting at roughly consistent times.\n- As latitude increases, there is greater variation in daylight duration between seasons. Summers have longer days and shorter nights, while winters have shorter days and longer nights.\n\n2. Twilight and Night Darkness:\n- At mid-latitudes (e.g., around 50° latitude), nights become longer in winter and the sun dips well below the horizon, allowing for full darkness.\n- Above 60° latitude, twilight persists for most or all of the night during summer, with the sun remaining relatively close (about 6.56°) below the horizon at midnight, leading to \"grey nights\" where it never gets fully dark.\n  \n3. Polar Phenomena at High Latitudes:\n- Above approximately 66.56° latitude (the Arctic and Antarctic Circles), there are periods during summer when the sun does not set at all (midnight sun), and conversely, periods in winter when the sun does not rise (polar night).\n- In these polar regions, during summer, the sun moves in a circular path around the sky at a nearly constant elevation, eliminating the typical concept of day and night.\n- During winter in these regions, the sun remains below the horizon, though twilight may still occur depending on latitude.\n\n4. Changing Solar Elevation Angles:\n- The maximum elevation of the sun at local noon decreases with increasing latitude, especially in winter, leading to colder temperatures and shorter days.\n- For example, at 70° latitude, the winter sun culminates at -3.44°, indicating it does not rise above the horizon, while the summer sun reaches 43.44° above the horizon.\n\nIn summary, moving away from the equator towards the poles results in more extreme variations in daylight and darkness throughout the year, including the phenomena of polar day, polar night, and prolonged twilight periods.",

        "rag_answer": "The Earth's axial tilt, which is about 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, is the primary reason for the sun's seasonal path changes across the sky. This tilt causes the Sun's apparent position to shift north and south over the course of the year, creating a 47-degree difference in the Sun's declination between the summer and winter solstices.\n\nAs a result:\n\n- During the summer solstice, the Sun rises northeast (in the Northern Hemisphere), reaches a higher peak in the sky (often slightly south of overhead), and sets northwest, leading to longer daylight hours and higher solar elevation.\n\n- During the winter solstice, the Sun rises southeast, stays lower in the sky (transiting the celestial meridian at a lower angle), and sets southwest, resulting in shorter daylight hours and lower solar elevation.\n\n- Around the equinoxes, the Sun rises due east and sets due west everywhere except at the poles, with its path crossing the sky roughly halfway between its summer and winter extremes.\n\nThis axial tilt and the resulting seasonal variation in the Sun's path affect the length of daytime, the angle of sunlight, and consequently, the amount of solar energy received at any given latitude during different times of the year. It also influences building design considerations such as window orientation, shading, and heating or cooling strategies to optimize solar gain or protection.",

        "rag_answer": "The sun's path, influenced primarily by the Earth's axial tilt and its seasonal changes, significantly affects building design in several ways:\n\n1. Orientation and Window Placement:\n- In the Northern Hemisphere, south-facing windows (the equator side) are ideal for capturing solar thermal energy, especially during winter when the sun is lower in the sky on that side.\n- In the Southern Hemisphere, north-facing windows serve this purpose.\nThis orientation helps maximize passive solar heating, reducing the need for additional heating.\n\n2. Overhangs and Shading Devices:\n- Latitude-dependent overhangs can be designed to block 100% of direct solar gain on the hottest days, preventing overheating and reducing cooling needs.\n- Additional shading devices like roll-down exterior screens, interior quilts, drapes, shutters, or movable trellises provide flexible control over sunlight and heat transfer on an hourly, daily, or seasonal basis without relying on active air conditioning.\n\n3. Seasonal Sun Angles:\n- Because the sun rises and sets at different angles and reaches varying elevations during seasons, building design must account for these variations to optimize daylight and heat gain.\n- For example, during summer, the sun rises in the northeast and sets in the northwest in the Northern Hemisphere, peaking slightly south of overhead; shading and window design need to accommodate this to minimize heat gain.\n\n4. Equinox Considerations:\n- Around equinoxes, the sun rises due east and sets due west everywhere except at the poles, peaking halfway up the sky.\n- This predictable sun path can inform window orientation and shading design to optimize natural daylight while minimizing glare and heat.\n\n5. Energy Efficiency and Climate Adaptation:\n- Understanding the sun path allows designers to balance solar heat gain and shading to improve energy efficiency for heating and cooling.\n- This knowledge also influences the design of solar energy systems, landscaping for shading, and the economic sizing and orientation of solar collectors and trackers.\n\nIn summary, knowledge of sun path and its seasonal changes guides building orientation, window placement, shading design, and energy system integration to enhance comfort, reduce energy consumption, and effectively use solar energy.",

( January 2008 ) Sun 's seasonal declination differences , viewed from some northern mid-latitude Sun path polar chart for any location at the latitude of Rotterdam Sun path , sometimes also called day arc , refers to the daily and seasonal arc - like path that the Sun appears to follow across the sky as the Earth rotates and orbits the Sun . The Sun 's path affects the length of daytime experienced and amount of daylight received along a certain latitude during a given season . The relative position of the Sun is a major factor in the heat gain of buildings and in the performance of solar energy systems . Accurate location - specific knowledge of sun path and climatic conditions is essential for economic decisions about solar collector area , orientation , landscaping , summer shading , and the cost - effective use of solar trackers .

Consider splitting it into new pages , adding subheadings , or condensing it . ( June 2017 ) Sun paths at any latitude and any time of the year can be determined from basic geometry . The Earth 's axis of rotation tilts about 23.5 degrees , relative to the plane of Earth 's orbit around the Sun . As the Earth orbits the Sun , this creates the 47 ° declination difference between the solstice sun paths , as well as the hemisphere - specific difference between summer and winter . In the Northern Hemisphere , the sun path near to the winter solstice ( November , December , January ) rises in the southeast , transits the celestial meridian at a low angle in the south ( more than 43 ° above the southern horizon in the tropics ) , and then sets in the southwest . It is on the south ( equator ) side of the house all day long . A vertical window facing south ( equator side ) is effective for capturing solar thermal energy . For comparison , the sun path near the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere ( May , June , July ) rises in the northeast , peaks out at a low angle in the north ( more than halfway up from the horizon in the tropics ) , and then sets in the northwest . There , the north - facing window would let in plenty of solar thermal energy to the house . In the Northern Hemisphere , the sun path near to the summer solstice ( May , June , July ) , the Sun rises in the northeast , peaks out slightly south of overhead point ( lower in the south at higher latitude ) , and then sets in the northwest , whereas in the Southern Hemisphere the sun path near the summer solstice ( November , December , January ) , the Sun rises in the southeast , peaks out slightly north of overhead point ( lower in the north at higher latitude ) , and then sets in the southwest . A simple latitude - dependent equator - side overhang can easily be designed to block 100 % of the direct solar gain from entering vertical equator - facing windows on the hottest days of the year . Roll - down exterior shade screens , interior translucent - or - opaque window quilts , drapes , shutters , movable trellises , etc. can be used for hourly , daily or seasonal sun and heat transfer control ( without any active electrical air conditioning ) . Everywhere around the world during the equinoxes ( March 20 / 21 and September 22 / 23 ) except for the poles , the sun rises due east and sets due west . In the Northern Hemisphere , the equinox sun peaks in the southern half ( about halfway up from the horizon at mid latitude ) of the sky , while in the Southern Hemisphere , that sun peaks in the northern half of the sky .

At this latitude at midnight ( around 1 a.m. with summer legal hour ) the summer sun is 16.56 ° below the horizon , which means that astronomical twilight continues the whole night . This phenomenon is known as the grey nights , nights when it does not get dark enough for astronomers to do their observations of the deep sky . Above 60 ° latitude the Sun would be even closer to the horizon , only 6.56 ° away from it . Then civil twilight continues almost all night , only a little bit of `` nautical twilight '' obviously around the local midnight .

    "title": "You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed",
    "document": "You laughed and laughed and laughed - wikipedia You laughed and laughed and laughed `` You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed '' is a poem by Nigerian writer Gabriel Okara . One of the most popular in his oeuvre , it is a frequent feature of anthologies , such as A New Book of African Verse edited by John Reed and Clive Wake ( Heinemann African Writers Series , 1985 ) . `` The piece belongs with the best of Senghor 's nostalgic verse , '' wrote Michael Echeruo in a tribute to Brutus on the occasion of his seventieth birthday , `` with the militancy of many of David Diop 's lyrics , and certainly with J.P. Clark 's ' Ivbie ' , another of my favorite African poems . Okara 's poem is more relaxed than these , however , more ironic , less tortured . In some ways , of course , it is less urgent , less strident , less involved . If Clark 's ' Ivbie ' was complex and for good reason , You laughed , and laughed , and laughed seemed also appropriately straightforward : proud without arrogance , hurting without showing it , and blunt without rudeness . '' The first of Okara 's poems that it was Echeruo 's pleasure to read , it was also in his opinion the most enduring . The poem is sometimes wrongly attributed to Dennis Brutus . Contents ( hide ) 1 Synopsis 2 Poem 3 References 4 Further reading Synopsis ( edit ) Gabriel Okara 's poem consists of 10 stanzas and describes the interplay of different interpretations of the same sounds , sights , and dances . The interaction that takes place within the poem is commonly thought to be between a white colonialist and an African native . The poem follows a trope in African literature of `` The White Man Laughed '' , which embodies the notion of dismay and cynical derision of the beliefs , practices , and norms of an African . However , Okara 's poem can be seen to transcend the acceptance of the derision of the White Man and present a wiser African intellectual . The poem concludes with the African teaching the White Man of his ignorance and helping him realize that the native beliefs of the African are not primitive nor removed from intellectual thought . As summarized by Pushpa Naidu Parekh , `` In ' You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed , ' the colonizer 's mockery and contemptuous disparagement of indigenous African culture and worldview are confronted and ultimately silenced by the warmth of the native 's ' fire ' laughter . '' Poem ( edit ) You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed In your ears my song is motor car misfiring stopping with a choking cough ; and you laughed and laughed and laughed . In your eyes my ante - natal walk was inhuman , passing your `` omnivorous understanding '' and you laughed and laughed and laughed You laughed at my song , you laughed at my walk . Then I danced my magic dance to the rhythm of talking drums pleading , but you shut your eyes and laughed and laughed and laughed And then I opened my mystic inside wide like the sky , instead you entered your car and laughed and laughed and laughed You laughed at my dance , you laughed at my inside . You laughed and laughed and laughed . But your laughter was ice - block laughter and it froze your inside froze your voice froze your ears froze your eyes and froze your tongue . And now it 's my turn to laugh ; but my laughter is not ice - block laughter . For I know not cars , know not ice - blocks . My laughter is the fire of the eye of the sky , the fire of the earth , the fire of the air , the fie of the seas and the rivers fishes animals trees and it thawed your inside , thawed your voice , thawed your ears , thawed your eyes and thawed your tongue . So a meek wonder held your shadow and you whispered ; `` Why so ? '' And I answered : `` Because my fathers and I are owned by the living warmth of the earth through our naked feet .

As of the 2016 United States Census , the city population was 7,154 . It is about 58 miles ( 93 km ) northwest of downtown Austin and 85 miles ( 137 km ) north of San Antonio . Lake Marble Falls is part of the Highland Lakes on the Colorado River , the largest chain of lakes in Texas . It hosts one of the largest drag boat races in the United States each August . Contents ( hide ) 1 History 2 Geography 3 Demographics 4 Notable people 5 Gallery 6 See also 7 References 8 External links History ( edit ) Marble Falls was founded in 1887 by Adam Rankin Johnson , a former Indian fighter and Confederate general , known as `` Stovepipe '' Johnson for his Civil War escapades , which included duping the Union army in Newburgh , Indiana , with fake `` cannons , '' constructed from stovepipes and wagon wheels . Johnson had viewed the natural Marble Falls during his pre-war days as a Burnet County surveyor , and had dreamed of building an industrial city , powered by the tumbling Colorado River , not to be confused with the river of the same name in Colorado and Arizona . Despite a `` friendly fire '' incident which blinded him near the end of the Civil War , General Johnson followed through with his dream , facilitating the construction of a railroad to nearby Granite Mountain in 1884 , then ( with ten partners , including one son , one nephew and two sons - in - law ) platting the townsite and selling lots , beginning July 12 , 1887 . Johnson built a fine home , a college ( soon to be home of the `` Falls on the Colorado Museum '' ) and a large factory near the falls . The town grew to a population of 1,800 within ten years . Marble Falls made history in 1917 by electing Ophelia Crosby `` Birdie '' Harwood as the nation 's first woman mayor , three years before women were allowed to vote . When the Max Starcke Dam was completed in 1951 , the marble falls which had given the town its name were submerged under the new Lake Marble Falls . While the town 's economy struggled through the drought of the 1950s , a new economy based on tourism and retirement began to grow in the 1970s . During the last thirty years , Marble Falls has grown into the retail and entertainment center for the Highland Lakes area , and continues to attract tourists , retirees and new businesses . Geography ( edit ) Marble Falls is located in southern Burnet County at 30 ° 34 ′ N 98 ° 17 ′ W ﻿ / ﻿ 30.567 ° N 98.283 ° W ﻿ / 30.567 ; - 98.283 ( 30.5741 , - 98.2782 ) , on the banks of Lake Marble Falls . According to the Handbook of Texas website , the former falls were flooded by the lake , which was created by a shelf of limestone running diagonally across the Colorado River from northeast to southwest . The upper layer of limestone , brownish on the exterior but a deep blue inside , was so hard and cherty it was mistaken for marble . The falls were actually three distinct formations at the head of a canyon 1.25 miles ( 2.01 km ) long , with a drop of some 50 feet ( 15 m ) through the limestone strata . The natural lake and waterfall were covered when the Colorado River was dammed with the completion of Max Starcke Dam in 1951 . A photo of the falls as they once existed can be seen at the website for the Wallace Guest House , a local bed and breakfast . Lake Marble Falls sits between Lake Lyndon B. Johnson to the north and Lake Travis to the south . The falls for which the city is named are now underwater but are revealed every few years when the lake is lowered . Equally noteworthy is the huge igneous batholith called Granite Mountain looming on the town 's western edge that secured Marble Falls ' place in Texas history . The famed pink granite was used for the construction of the Texas State Capitol and other state government office buildings , and can also be found in the Galveston Seawall and Austin -- Bergstrom International Airport . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 12.2 square miles ( 31.6 km ) , of which 11.6 square miles ( 30.0 km ) is land and 0.62 square miles ( 1.6 km ) , or 5.21 % , is water .
