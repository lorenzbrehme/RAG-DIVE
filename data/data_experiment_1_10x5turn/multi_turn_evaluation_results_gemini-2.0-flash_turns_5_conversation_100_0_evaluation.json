A key early origin is an 1814 fable titled \"The Inquisitive Man\" by Ivan Andreevich Krylov, which tells of a man who notices all sorts of tiny things in a museum but fails to notice an elephant. This fable helped make the phrase proverbial. Fyodor Dostoevsky also referenced this idea in his novel \"Demons,\" likening a character to Krylov's man who didn't notice the elephant in the museum. The Oxford English Dictionary cites the first recorded use of the phrase as a simile in The New York Times on June 20, 1959. However, the phrase appeared earlier, such as in a British journal in 1915, and Mark Twain wrote a story in 1882, \"The Stolen White Elephant,\" which also plays on the concept. Thus, the phrase evolved from these literary and cultural references underscoring the idea of an obvious problem or issue being ignored.",

In legal contexts, it refers to the authority and responsibility of the state to act as a guardian for those who are unable to care for themselves, such as children, incapacitated individuals, or disabled persons. The doctrine empowers the state to intervene against abusive or negligent parents, legal guardians, or caregivers and to take protective actions in the best interests of these vulnerable individuals.\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- The notion of parens patriae originated in English common law, with roots tracing back to at least the early 17th century (e.g., Coke's Report of Calvin's Case in 1608).\n- Originally, it was associated with the sovereign's absolute rights and duties over individuals who were deemed non compos mentis (not of sound mind), including mentally incapacitated adults.\n- Over time, the doctrine evolved to emphasize the state's role in safeguarding the welfare of children and incapacitated adults, marking a shift from sovereign dominance to protective oversight.\n- Historically, parens patriae was invoked by the King's Bench in cases concerning individuals who could not manage their own affairs, especially children.\n\n**Modern Applications:**\n- In many jurisdictions today, parens patriae informs family law and child welfare proceedings, where courts prioritize the \"best interests of the child\" as the paramount concern.\n- The doctrine allows courts to override parental decisions or agreements if they are deemed harmful to the child's welfare. For example, custody arrangements or agreements made by parents may be set aside if not aligned with the child's best interests.\n- The doctrine extends to adults with impaired mental capacity who require protection, with courts having the jurisdiction to appoint guardians ad litem or arrange for long-term care (e.g., through courts of protection in English law).\n- At the state level in the United States, parens patriae grants states standing to sue on behalf of their citizens to protect public interests. This has been applied in various contexts, including environmental protection, antitrust litigation, and public health.\n- Examples of parens patriae suits in U.S. federal courts include states suing other states or corporations to prevent harm to their citizens, such as cases involving pollution, water rights, antitrust violations, and more.\n- The doctrine also underlies some rights within the European Union context, emphasizing the child's right to be heard and the child's best interests in all actions taken by public authorities or private institutions, reflecting fundamental human rights principles (Article 24 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights).\n\nIn summary, parens patriae is a foundational legal principle that empowers the state to act as a protector or guardian for individuals who cannot protect themselves, evolving historically from sovereign prerogative to a modern doctrine focused on welfare, rights, and public interest.",

For instance, if parents agree on a custody arrangement that the court finds harmful or detrimental to the child's well-being, the court will intervene under the parens patriae doctrine to protect the child\u2019s best interests, even if that means overriding the parents' decisions.",

For example:\n\n- In any legal proceedings affecting the validity of a marriage, children are not parties in their own right, and courts closely scrutinize arrangements made by spouses regarding parental responsibility to ensure they serve the child's best interests.\n\n- The doctrine empowers courts to intervene in cases where parental decisions, contracts, or arbitration awards conflict with the child's best interests, treating such conflicting agreements as void in respect to the child.\n\n- It applies in protecting children from neglect or abuse by parents, guardians, or caretakers who fail to provide adequate care.\n\nFurthermore, the doctrine is also relevant to individuals other than children, such as incapacitated or mentally impaired adults who need protection. In these cases, courts may appoint guardians ad litem or arrange long-term care under their parens patriae jurisdiction.\n\nIn summary, parens patriae applies to a broad range of child welfare considerations beyond custody, encompassing any situation where state intervention is necessary to protect the child's well-being.",

For example, Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union explicitly recognizes the child\u2019s right to be heard in proceedings affecting them and mandates that the child\u2019s best interests shall be a primary consideration in all actions involving children by public authorities or private institutions. This highlights the EU's commitment to protecting vulnerable individuals in a manner consistent with parens patriae principles.\n\nIn other international contexts, similar protective roles of the state can be found, though they may not be labeled explicitly as \"parens patriae.\" Many countries have legal frameworks that empower courts or state authorities to act in the best interests of children or incapacitated adults, intervening when individuals cannot protect themselves.\n\nMoreover, in the United States, parens patriae has an expanded application, including states suing on behalf of their citizens in federal courts to protect public interests, such as environmental protection and antitrust enforcement.\n\nIn summary, while the terminology and exact legal mechanisms differ, the broad principle that the state has a protective role over vulnerable individuals\u2014embodied in parens patriae\u2014is widely recognized internationally, particularly in family law, child welfare, and public interest litigation contexts.",

Invasive plants cover around 10% of the entire country and are the most significant threat to fynbos. The common invasive species include wattles and hakeas from Australia, and pines from Europe and the Californian coast of the United States. Pines were introduced in the 19th century, and wattles were imported in the mid-1870s to stabilize sand dunes.\n\nIn 1997, it was estimated that the invasion of these alien species caused the fynbos region to decline in economic value by about US $750 million per year. These invasive plants also sequester nearly 9.95% of usable surface water runoff, affecting the water availability in the region.\n\nTo combat these threats, the South African Department of Water Affairs and Forestry started the Working for Water (WfW) program in 1995. This program aims to control invasive species and has cleared over 1,000,000 hectares of land so far. It also provides employment to about 20,000 people annually, many of whom are women and unskilled workers.\n\nBesides invasive species, agriculture and global warming pose ongoing threats to the fynbos, particularly in the lowland and montane areas where the flora is more intact and water sources are vital.\n\nConservation efforts continue, with anecdotal evidence suggesting the return of certain endemic species such as silver peas after invasive species removal.

This means that the way we perceive or understand something is not determined solely by the stimulus itself but is also shaped by the context in which it occurs.\n\nContext effects are part of top-down processing, where prior knowledge, experiences, and environmental cues help interpret sensory information. This contrasts with bottom-up processing, which relies solely on sensory data. Often, both types of processing work together when people perceive stimuli.\n\nFor example, context effects help us read difficult handwriting by allowing us to use surrounding letters and words to identify ambiguous letters correctly. Similarly, our perception of sounds can be altered by the background noise or other environmental sounds. These effects illustrate how context facilitates recognition and comprehension.\n\nContext effects also impact memory, as people tend to recall information better when they are in the same environment where they initially learned it\u2014a phenomenon known as transfer-appropriate processing.\n\nIn summary, context effects demonstrate that perception and cognitive processes are influenced by the larger environment and previous experiences, allowing individuals to interpret stimuli more accurately and efficiently.",

To leverage the similarity effect and boost sales of a particular product, companies strategically reduce the number of very similar competing products, helping their focal product stand out and attract more buyers.\n\nA real-world example, though not explicitly detailed in the context but aligned with this principle, would be how Apple Inc. manages its product lineup. Apple typically offers a limited number of smartphone models with distinct features rather than multiple very similar models. By minimizing product similarity within its lineup, Apple reduces internal competition among its own products, allowing each model to target different customer segments clearly. This strategy helps boost sales by preventing consumers from being overwhelmed by nearly identical choices and focusing their attention on standout products.\n\nTherefore, Apple's streamlined product offering can be seen as a practical application of the similarity effect to increase sales effectiveness.\n\nIf you are looking for a more specific documented example from the literature, the provided context does not mention a named company directly applying the similarity effect. However, many firms use this strategy by carefully managing their product assortments to minimize cannibalization among similar items.",

While it was classically thought that Wernicke's area primarily corresponds to the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and is the main site for language comprehension and speech recognition, recent neuroimaging studies suggest that the functions attributed to Wernicke's area actually occur more broadly throughout the temporal lobe and also involve Broca's area.\n\nSpecifically, areas such as the middle and inferior temporal gyri and basal temporal cortex have roles in lexical processing. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) from its rostral to caudal fields and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) contain neural tissue critical for speech recognition. Moreover, aspects of Broca's area (Brodmann areas 44 and 45) are also regularly implicated in speech processing.\n\nTherefore, the range of areas involved in speech processing extends well beyond the classical Wernicke's area, indicating that speech perception and language processing are more distributed than previously thought.",

Phases can be different states of matter (such as solid, liquid, gas, plasma) or distinct forms within the same state (e.g., different crystal structures in solids).

At specific points called phase boundaries, two or more phases can coexist in equilibrium, as at the triple point where three phases coexist.\n\nIn essence, the quantity and type of phases that will form at a given temperature and pressure depend on the thermodynamic conditions and the material's properties, and these are usually determined experimentally. The interaction of temperature and pressure dictates whether the substance exists as a single phase or separates into multiple distinct phases, each with uniform properties internally but different from each other.\n\nHence, the factors that determine which phases are possible include:\n\n1. The temperature and pressure conditions of the system.\n\n2. The material's phase boundaries as shown in its phase diagram.\n\n3.

The musical premiered on Broadway in 1997 and was revived in 2013. \"In His Eyes\" is performed by the two female lead characters, Lucy and Emma.\n\nContext:\nJekyll and Hyde tells the story of Dr. Jekyll, who develops an evil alter ego, Hyde, while trying to understand the basis of good and evil. Emma, Jekyll's fianc\u00e9e, is a refined woman who is concerned about Jekyll's experiments, fearing he is becoming too involved. Lucy is a prostitute who becomes infatuated with Hyde, the darker persona. Both women love the same man but different facets of his personality.\n\nThe song expresses the separate desires of Lucy and Emma for Jekyll/Hyde, lamenting how their lives are changed by him. Each woman sings about her dreams and desires regarding their future with or without Jekyll/Hyde, ultimately recognizing that their love is too strong to break away. They find that looking into his eyes fills them with the strength to continue, ending the song with a mutual commitment to him.\n\nMusical and Textual Aspects:\n- The duet features Emma as a soprano with a classical operatic tone and Lucy as a mezzo-soprano with a raspy tone. They sing similar melodies but with different lyrics, and their parts overlap without true interaction, often portrayed as each in their own world.\n- The song begins in C minor, reflecting uncertainty, and modulates to B-flat major as they express adoration.\n- Emma's vocal range in the song spans from Bb to Eb (two octaves above middle C), while Lucy's ranges from Bb to F (two octaves above).\n- The song is accompanied by a rich orchestration including bass, cello, horn, keyboards, percussion, various woodwinds, brass, and strings.\n- Lyrically, Emma sings of her pain and confusion over Jekyll's transformation, while Lucy sings of her fascination and confusion about loving a man she cannot fully understand.\n- The song develops their characters and emotional states without advancing the main plot.\n- \"In His Eyes\" has been recorded by the Original Broadway Cast and various other artists, and has even been adapted into a solo piece.\n\nOverall, \"In His Eyes\" is a poignant expression of love and longing from two very different women connected by their love for the complex character of Jekyll/Hyde.",

The show stars Jason Bateman, who also directed several episodes, including the first two and last two episodes of season one. The series was first released on Netflix on July 21, 2017.\n\nThe story centers on Marty Byrde (played by Jason Bateman), a self-employed financial advisor from Chicago who, along with his business partner, began laundering money for a Mexican drug cartel in 2007. After a money laundering scheme goes wrong, Marty relocates his family \u2014 wife Wendy (played by Laura Linney), daughter Charlotte, and son Jonah \u2014 to a modest waterfront resort at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri to appease the cartel and keep his family safe. Wendy becomes a realtor and helps identify local businesses to use for money laundering.\n\nThe show explores the Byrde family's dealings with local criminals, including a crime lord Jacob Snell and his wife Darlene, the Langmore family, and FBI agents investigating Marty\u2019s activities. Ruth Langmore, a young woman from a local criminal family, becomes involved in Marty\u2019s operations.\n\nOzark is set mostly in Georgia (Lake Allatoona and Lake Lanier) for filming, with some scenes shot in Chicago and only a few in the actual Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri area. The series has received generally favorable reviews, particularly for Bateman's performance, drawing comparisons to shows like Breaking Bad.\n\nThe first season consists of nine one-hour episodes plus a final 80-minute episode. The series was renewed for a 10-episode second season. The tone of the series is dark and gripping, focusing on crime, family dynamics, and survival in a dangerous environment.",

These areas are also known as the \"calms of Cancer\" in the Northern Hemisphere and the \"calms of Capricorn\" in the Southern Hemisphere.

The \"Dead Horse\" Ritual Theory: The term is likely derived from the \"dead horse\" ritual of seamen. In this practice, sailors paraded a straw-stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck and then threw it overboard. This ritual celebrated the period when sailors had worked off their \"dead horse\" debt\u2014the time after spending their advance pay and before receiving more pay, which often lasted a month or two. Westbound ships from Europe typically reached the subtropics around this time, associating the latitude with the ceremony.\n\n2. The Spanish Horses Theory (Folk Etymology): According to a popular but less substantiated theory, the term originated from Spanish ships transporting horses to their colonies in the Americas. Ships often became becalmed at these latitudes, prolonging the voyage and causing water shortages that made it impossible to keep the horses alive, leading crews to throw dead or dying horses overboard.\n\n3. The Maritime \"Horsed\" Theory: Edward Taube suggested that \"horse latitudes\" comes from the maritime term \"horsed,\" meaning a ship making good progress by riding strong ocean currents despite insufficient wind for sailing. Thus, ships were metaphorically \"horsed\" along by currents at these latitudes. This term was in use since the late 17th century.\n\nThese are the main theories explaining the origin of the name \"horse latitudes.\"",

It gained prominence during the Crimean War and the American Civil War. Its development was significant because it was the first projectile small enough to be easily loaded down the barrel of a rifled long gun. Rifling\u2014the addition of spiral grooves inside the gun barrel\u2014imparted a spin to the bullet, greatly increasing the gun's range and accuracy.\n\nDesign:\nThe Mini\u00e9 ball was a conical bullet featuring three exterior grease-filled grooves and a conical hollow in its base. It incorporated a small iron plug and a lead skirt designed to expand under firing pressure, sealing the barrel and increasing muzzle velocity. Captain James H. Burton later improved its design by adding a deep cavity at the base that filled with gas to expand the bullet's rim upon firing, enhancing range and reducing manufacturing costs.\n\nUse:\nThe Mini\u00e9 ball could be rapidly removed from a paper cartridge; the gunpowder was poured down the rifle barrel and the bullet pressed past the muzzle rifling and detritus. It was then rammed down the barrel with a ramrod. Upon firing, expanding gases deformed the bullet\u2019s skirt to engage the rifling, providing spin for improved accuracy, a better seal for consistent velocity and range, and helped clean barrel residue.\n\nEffects in the American Civil War:\n- The Mini\u00e9 ball had higher muzzle velocity and greater mass than round balls used in smoothbore muskets, allowing it to penetrate the human body more easily.\n- Unlike round balls, which often lodged in flesh and followed unpredictable paths due to muscle and bone deflections, the Mini\u00e9 ball tended to cut a straight path and usually passed entirely through the target.\n- When striking bone, the Mini\u00e9 ball often caused bones to shatter, resulting in severe compound fractures frequently requiring amputation.\n- Its use significantly increased the lethality of rifle fire during the Civil War, contributing to high casualty rates.\n\nBoth the American Springfield and British Enfield rifles\u2014the most common rifles used during the American Civil War\u2014utilized the Mini\u00e9 ball ammunition, making it a central element in the warfare of the period.",

This gas expansion caused the bullet's rim (or skirt) to expand more effectively to engage the rifling.\n\n2. Expansion Mechanism:\n   - In Mini\u00e9's design, the lead skirt expanded primarily due to the pressure of the gunpowder explosion and the action of the iron plug.\n   - Burton's design leveraged the expanding gas itself filling the deep cavity, which forced the skirt outward, resulting in a better seal against the barrel rifling grooves.\n\n3. Performance:\n   - Burton's design resulted in improved range and accuracy compared to Mini\u00e9's original design.\n   - Additionally, Burton's version was cheaper to produce.\n\nOverall, Burton's addition of the deep cavity at the base that filled with gas allowed for better expansion of the bullet's skirt upon firing, enhancing the bullet's engagement with the rifling, which improved both performance and cost-efficiency relative to Mini\u00e9's original design.",

This results in an incomplete and often misleading representation of the facts, giving a false impression that the chosen examples or data are representative of the whole.\n\nOne-sided arguments, also known as card stacking, stacking the deck, or suppressed evidence, occur when only reasons supporting a proposition are presented, while all opposing reasons are omitted. Although this does not necessarily make the argument invalid or unsound, it means the evidence is incomplete and the audience is persuaded without being exposed to the full range of relevant information.\n\nIn essence, cherry picking is a key mechanism by which one-sided arguments are constructed. By cherry picking evidence, an arguer creates a one-sided argument that emphasizes supporting points and suppresses counterarguments, thereby skewing the perception of the issue. This selective use of information can distort public debate and hinder critical examination because the omitted evidence might be stronger or more compelling than the presented evidence.\n\nTherefore, cherry picking is often the underlying strategy that leads to one-sided arguments, both serving to mislead by presenting an imbalanced and partial view of the topic under discussion.",

This practice is considered poor science or pseudo-science. For instance, a scientist might highlight experimental results that show a positive effect of a treatment but omit data from the same study or other studies that show no effect or negative effects, thereby giving a misleading impression of the treatment's efficacy.\n\nRichard Somerville, in testimony before the US House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power (March 8, 2011), described cherry picking as making selective choices among competing evidence to emphasize results supporting a given position while ignoring any findings that do not support it.\n\nRigorous and reliable science looks at all the evidence, controls variables to identify what is actually working, uses blinded observations to minimize bias, and employs internally consistent logic, rather than cherry picking favorable evidence.",

            "content": "Cherry picking in medicine, as described in the provided context, involves selectively including or excluding certain patients, data, or results to create a misleading impression about the efficacy or applicability of a treatment. For example, the 2002 study mentioned reviews antidepressant efficacy trials and finds that many trials exclude patients with certain profiles, meaning the trial results may not generalize well to the broader population seen in routine clinical practice. This selective inclusion or exclusion is a form of cherry picking because it suppresses evidence that might contradict or nuance the apparent effectiveness of a treatment.\n\nComparing this to cherry picking more generally, the core principle remains the same: selectively presenting only favorable data or cases while ignoring those that contradict or complicate the position. In medicine, this can lead to treatments appearing more effective or universally applicable than they truly are because contrary or complicating evidence from non-included patients or studies is left out.\n\nIn summary, cherry picking in medicine specifically manifests in practices like selective trial participant criteria, ignoring adverse effects, or overlooking negative study outcomes, which parallels the general concept of cherry picking where evidence is selectively presented to support a specific viewpoint while suppressing contradictory evidence. Such cherry picking in medicine can compromise the validity and reliability of clinical conclusions, just as it does in other areas.",

At 11:00 a.m. every day, the ducks are ceremoniously escorted via elevator to the lobby, where they march across a red carpet to the fountain, accompanied by John Philip Sousa's \"King Cotton March.\" At 5:00 p.m., the ducks are led back to their rooftop residence. This tradition, known as the Peabody Duck March, is rare and has gained the ducks celebrity status, appearing on various television shows and media.\n\nIn addition to the duck tradition, the Peabody Hotel is a luxury hotel located in Downtown Memphis, Tennessee, known for its Italian Renaissance architecture designed by Walter W. Ahlschlager. The hotel has a rich history dating back to 1869 with the original Peabody Hotel, and the current building opened in 1925. It is a member of the Historic Hotels of America and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Peabody is also recognized for its large red neon signs atop the Skyway Ballroom and has several notable design features, including the rooftop \"Duck Palace\" and the Skyway Ballroom with views of Memphis skyscrapers.",

It disregards the timing and risk of cash flows, which can lead to less accurate assessments of an investment\u2019s profitability, especially for long-term projects.

Additionally, Bangor was historically important as the site of the 1779 Penobscot Expedition during the American Revolutionary War and was sacked by the British during the War of 1812. The city also developed around the river as an important center for lumbering and later papermaking industries, utilizing the river for transport and power. Furthermore, the average high tide at Bangor is notably 13 feet (4 meters), indicating its importance as a tidal and navigable location on the river.",

Accord: This is a new agreement in which the parties agree to discharge the original obligation. The accord must have all the essential terms of a contract, including parties involved, subject matter, time for performance, and consideration (something of value exchanged).\n\n2. Satisfaction: This refers to the performance or consideration that fulfills the terms of the accord. Satisfaction is the legal \"consideration\" that binds the parties to the new agreement.\n\nThe purpose of accord and satisfaction is to terminate the original contract by substituting it with a new agreement, which suspends the right to enforce the original contract until the new agreement is performed. Upon satisfaction of the accord, both the original contract and the accord are discharged.\n\nIf there is a breach of the accord (e.g., non-performance), the non-offending party has the right to sue either under the original contract or the new accord contract.\n\nFor example, if a homeowner was supposed to pay $7,500 to a builder upon completion of a garage, but they agree to settle the matter with a payment of $4,000 due to complaints about the work quality, the acceptance of $4,000 in full payment constitutes accord and satisfaction. This new agreement serves as a defense against any lawsuit demanding the original full payment.\n\nIn summary, accord and satisfaction involve:\n\n- A new agreement (accord) to settle the debt or obligation, usually with different or lesser consideration.\n- The execution or performance of that new agreement (satisfaction).\n- Discharge of the original contract upon satisfaction.\n- Legal binding of the parties to the new terms.\n\nIt is a way to peacefully resolve contract disputes without litigation.",

This veil means that these individuals do not know any specific details about themselves, such as their gender, race, intelligence, social class, wealth, abilities, or personal tastes. Because they lack this knowledge, they cannot tailor principles based on their own self-interest or class position.\n\nBy placing themselves behind this veil, decision-makers are compelled to consider society from an impartial perspective, as they could end up in any position within that society, including the least advantaged. This ensures that the principles chosen are fair and just for all members of society, particularly the worst-off, since no one would want to create a system that disadvantages them if they might be in that position.\n\nRawls argues that this condition encourages moral considerations when choosing societal principles and makes personal biases irrelevant in evaluating justice. The veil of ignorance is part of a broader tradition of social contract theory, and Rawls' formulation helps ensure that freedom and equality can coexist in a just society.",

This means decision-makers do not know their own social positions or personal characteristics.\n- Goal: The aim is to establish fair and just principles that protect all, especially the least advantaged, because decision-makers do not know where they will end up in society.\n- Emphasis: The focus is on fairness, impartiality, and ensuring that the rules of society are justifiable to all members under conditions of equality and ignorance of personal circumstances.\n- Outcome: The resulting principles are designed to secure freedom and equality in a way that every individual can accept as just.\n\n2. Utilitarianism (as per John Harsanyi's perspective):\n- Focus: Utilitarianism centers on maximizing overall welfare or the greatest good for the greatest number.\n- Application of Veil of Ignorance: John Harsanyi formalized the veil of ignorance concept in economics, arguing that when individuals decide without knowing their position, they would support policies maximizing total or average utility.\n- Goal: The aim is to maximize expected utility or happiness rather than ensuring fairness to every individual position.\n- Outcome: The social rules or principles chosen would seek to increase overall well-being, potentially at the cost of inequality, as long as the total or average utility is maximized.\n\nIn summary, while the social contract approach behind the veil of ignorance emphasizes fairness and justice for all\u2014including protecting the least advantaged\u2014utilitarianism focuses on maximizing total societal welfare, which may allow for inequalities if they lead to greater overall utility.

Misregulation of Gene Expression:  \nA translocation can relocate a proto-oncogene next to a strong enhancer or promoter sequence from another chromosome. For example, in Burkitt's lymphoma, a chromosomal translocation places an enhancer sequence near the MYC gene, causing MYC transcription factors to be produced at much higher levels. This overproduction drives increased transcription of genes that promote cell proliferation.\n\n2. Creation of Fusion Genes Encoding Constitutively Active Proteins:  \nSome translocations fuse parts of two different genes, creating a fusion gene that encodes a hybrid protein with abnormal, constitutive activity. The Philadelphia chromosome in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is a classic example where parts of chromosomes 9 and 22 fuse to form the BCR-ABL gene. The BCR-ABL fusion protein is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that continuously activates signaling pathways for cell cycle progression and cell division, leading to uncontrolled proliferation.\n\nIn both cases, these changes disrupt normal control mechanisms of the cell cycle and apoptosis, leading to unchecked cell growth and cancer development.",

Most of the rivers in this region are seasonal and dry up during the summer season, so they cannot supply water to canals year-round.\n4. Several streams become torrential during the rainy season, and constructing embankments and tanks to impound this water makes the best use of it; otherwise, the water would go to waste and flow into the sea.\n5. The scattered nature of the population and agricultural fields favors tank irrigation.\n\nThese factors make tank irrigation a practical and effective water management technique in South India, where seasonal rainfall and challenging terrain affect water availability.",

Much water is evaporated from the large expanse of shallow water and is thus not available for irrigation.\n4. Tanks cover large areas of cultivable land, which might otherwise be used for agriculture.\n5. In many areas, other sources of irrigation have been adopted and the dry beds of tanks have been reclaimed for agriculture.\n6.

In 1975, the village was drought-stricken, and its tank could not hold water due to leaks in the earthen embankment dam wall. The villagers began work on constructing a percolation tank and donated their labor to repair the embankment. After these efforts, the village's seven wells below the tank filled with water in the summer for the first time in memory, providing a water supply throughout the year. This revitalization of the ancient tank system significantly improved the village's water availability.",

            "content": "The provided context does not explicitly state whether temple tanks are managed differently from village tanks. However, some distinctions can be inferred from the descriptions:\n\n- Village tanks, such as the example of Ralegaon Siddhi, are primarily used for irrigation and drinking water. They are often community-managed, with villagers actively participating in construction, maintenance, and repair (e.g., repairing embankments and constructing percolation tanks). Their management involves practical restoration and ongoing maintenance to ensure water supply throughout the year.\n\n- Temple tanks, known as \"Pushkarni,\" \"Kalyani,\" or \"Kund,\" are reservoirs typically located within temple complexes. Their use is more ritualistic and sacred, associated with bathing for cures and religious purposes. The context also notes that many temple tanks are decaying and drying up today, implying possibly less active or formal maintenance.\n\nIn summary, village tanks appear to be managed with a practical, community-based approach focused on irrigation and water supply, while temple tanks have a sacred function and may not receive the same level of active management, leading to their decay. This suggests there are differences in use and management emphasis between the two types of tanks.",

The functions activated by these buttons appeared more random, with different buttons activating various abilities inconsistently across episodes.\n\n2. Functions Activation: Some of the original functions were changed or activated differently. For example:\n   - Control A = Jump Jacks (originally called Auto Jacks), used for jumping the car.\n   - Control B = Bullet-proof polymer deflector (different from original where B activated grip tires).\n   - Control C = Tire Shields, replacing previous functions.\n   - Control D = Emergency spare tires.\n   - Control E = Zircon-tipped cutter blades (rotary saws).\n   - Control F = Tire crampon grips suited for various terrain.\n   - Control G = Homing robot, similar to original but unused in the film.\n\n3. Abandonment and Replacement of Functions: The underwater functions like Frogger Mode and Evening Eye were completely abandoned in the remake and replaced with new functions exclusive to racing combat.\n\n4. Added Features: The special functions were not built-in from the beginning but were added to allow the car to participate in specific off-track races like the Casa Cristo 5000.\n\n5. General Design Aesthetics: The overall appearance of the Mach Five was extensively modified, including its body built on a 2001 Chevrolet Corvette chassis in one real-life prototype, which was a significant departure from the original car\u2019s design.\n\nOverall, the 1993 remake featured a more combat-oriented Mach Five with revamped controls, altered gadget functions, and a design focused on racing combat rather than the varied functions seen in the original series.",

            "content": "Tax incidence, also known as tax burden, is the analysis of the effect of a particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare between consumers and producers. It refers to who ultimately bears the economic burden of a tax\u2014the consumers, the producers, or both\u2014and how much each group pays.\n\nWhen a tax is introduced on a good or service, it creates a difference between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive. The incidence of the tax does not depend on who formally pays the tax to the government (the legal incidence), but rather on the relative price elasticities of supply and demand.\n\nKey points about tax incidence:\n\n1. **Depends on Elasticity:**  \n   - If the demand for a product is inelastic (consumers are not sensitive to price changes), consumers bear most of the tax burden because they will continue to buy the product despite higher prices.  \n   - If the supply is inelastic (producers cannot easily change the quantity supplied), producers bear more of the tax burden as they cannot reduce their output easily.  \n   - If both supply and demand have similar elasticities, the tax burden is shared between producers and consumers.\n\n2. **Examples:**  \n   - For a tax on apples, if consumers are insensitive to price changes, the apple farmer can pass the entire tax onto consumers by raising prices. In this case, consumers bear the entire tax burden.  \n   - If consumers are very sensitive to price changes (elastic demand), the farmer cannot raise prices much without losing sales, so the farmer bears more of the tax burden.\n\n3. **Pass-Through Fraction:**  \n   The portion of the tax passed on to consumers can be calculated using the formula:  \n   Pass-through fraction to buyers = PES / (PES - PED)  \n   where PES is the price elasticity of supply and PED is the price elasticity of demand.\n\n4. **Economic Welfare:**  \n   The true burden of tax goes beyond just payments; it includes the loss in consumer surplus (benefit consumers get from buying a good) and producer surplus (profit producers make). Taxes cause distortions in the market which can lead to lost economic welfare.\n\n5. **Macroeconomic Considerations:**  \n   The burden may also shift depending on broader economic factors, tax revenue usage, and labor market conditions. For instance, payroll taxes might be legally split between employers and employees, but economic incidence might fall more heavily on employees via lower wages.\n\nIn summary, tax incidence analysis explains who really pays a tax, how the burden is shared, and how taxes affect economic welfare, mainly depending on how sensitive consumers and producers are to price changes.",

During the drill, the bucket brigade was supposed to draw water from the starboard side, carry it to the engine room to extinguish the fire, and a separate crew was to remove the used water from the engine room and throw it over the port side to prevent flooding. However, due to confusion in translation, the brigade mistakenly took water from the starboard side, ran over to the port side, and threw it overboard, completely bypassing the engine room. This confusion and chaos in the drill led to the term being used to describe chaotic or confusing situations. The term was also used during World War II by the U.S. Marine Corps, and later during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, often in the phrase \"as screwed up as a Chinese fire drill.\"",

It is the shortest of the three canals and is oriented approximately 30 degrees above the horizontal plane.\n\nStructure:\n- It measures about 12 to 15 mm in length.\n- Its arch is directed horizontally backward and laterally.\n- The ampullated end (a dilated sac called the osseous ampulla) is located at the upper and lateral angle of the vestibule, just above the oval window, where it opens close to the ampullated end of the superior canal.\n- Its opposite end opens at the upper and back part of the vestibule.\n- The lateral semicircular canal of one ear is nearly in the same plane as that of the other ear.\n\nFunction:\n- The horizontal semicircular canal detects angular acceleration of the head when the head is rotated around a vertical axis (i.e., turning the head left and right, such as looking both ways before crossing a road).\n- It is responsible for sensing rotation in the transverse plane.\n- The fluid within the canal, called endolymph, moves when the head rotates; this movement lags behind the canal's movement due to inertia and acts on the cupula (a gelatinous structure within the ampulla), bending the hair cells' cilia inside.\n- This bending stimulates the hair cells, which send nerve signals to the brain indicating head rotation.\n\nOverall, the horizontal semicircular canal plays a critical role in detecting rotational movements of the head around a vertical axis, contributing to the sense of balance and spatial orientation.",

Pilots experience \"the leans\" because when they enter a sustained turn, the semicircular canals in their inner ear initially detect the rotation, and the hair cells are stimulated, sending signals to the brain that the head (and aircraft) is turning. However, if the turn is maintained at a constant rate, the endolymph fluid inside the semicircular canals eventually catches up with the movement of the canal ducts due to inertia, causing the cupula to no longer be deflected. This stops the sensation of acceleration, and the pilot no longer feels like they are turning even though they are.\n\nWhen the pilot then exits the turn, the semicircular canals are stimulated in the opposite direction, making the pilot feel as if they are turning the other way. To compensate, the pilot may lean in the direction of the original turn, which is the illusion known as \"the leans.\" This sensory confusion can sometimes lead to dangerous situations, such as a graveyard spiral.",

Additionally, the upcoming comic Halloween: The Mark of Thorn is set to feature Jamie Lloyd along with other characters like Tommy Doyle, Rachel Carruthers, and the Man in Black. \n\nRegarding casting, Danielle Harris, who originally portrayed Jamie, sought to reprise her role in Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (the sixth film). However, the producers and Dimension Films reportedly refused her request for a higher salary, and she was not fond of the script. Consequently, the role was given to J.C. Brandy.

Traditional views suggested a factional struggle between William Cecil (later Lord Burghley) and Robert Dudley over matters like marriage alliances and intervention in the Netherlands. However, revisionist historians argue that there was no true factional division during this earlier period; instead, disagreements were over individual opinions and judgments on policy. After the removal of the conservative Duke of Norfolk, all councillors generally agreed on supporting the Protestant cause, even if they differed on how to intervene in the Netherlands.\n\nTherefore, while some internal disagreements and competing interests existed within the Privy Council, especially in the later years, it is debated whether these constituted formal factions.",

They are considered unrestricted free agents and have the freedom to negotiate and sign contracts with any NFL team they choose. They do not have any negotiating restrictions.\n\n- Restricted Free Agents (RFAs): These players have three accrued seasons of service, and their contracts have expired. They receive qualifying offers from their original club and are free to negotiate with any other club until a deadline (approximately a week before the NFL Draft). However, their original club has the right to match any offer they receive from a new club and retain the player. If the original club chooses not to match, it may receive draft pick compensation depending on the offer. Thus, RFAs have limited negotiating rights compared to unrestricted free agents.\n\n- Unrestricted Free Agents (UFAs): These players have completed four or more accrued seasons of service and have expired contracts. They have full negotiating rights and are free to sign with any franchise without restrictions.\n\nIn summary, undrafted free agents and unrestricted free agents have full negotiating rights with any team, while restricted free agents can negotiate with other teams but their original team has the right to match offers and potentially receive compensation.",

It addresses the trope of \"The White Man Laughed,\" which symbolizes the colonialist's cynical derision and dismissal of African beliefs, practices, and worldview as primitive or unintellectual. Throughout the poem, the white man laughs mockingly at the native's song, walk, dance, and inner self.\n\nHowever, the poem transcends mere acceptance of this derision. It presents a wiser African intellectual who ultimately teaches the white man of his ignorance. The African\u2019s laughter, described as warm and powerful like \"the fire of the eye of the sky,\" contrasts with the cold \"ice-block laughter\" of the white man, which freezes his senses. This warming laughter thaws the white man's frozen inside, voice, ears, eyes, and tongue, leading him to a reflective question and the African's response that they are \"owned by the living warmth of the earth through our naked feet.\"\n\nThe poem celebrates African identity and cultural depth, challenging colonial condescension with pride and intellect but without arrogance or rudeness. It is considered a straightforward yet profound work, proud and hurting without showing it, and notable for its ironic tone.\n\nIt has sometimes been mistakenly attributed to Dennis Brutus but is firmly credited to Gabriel Okara. Scholars like Michael Echeruo have praised it as enduring and among the best of African poetry, aligning with the nostalgic and militant themes of prominent African poets.\n\nIn summary, \"You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed\" is a poetic confrontation of colonial mockery, ending in a powerful affirmation of African cultural richness and intellectualism.",

This laughter is not warm or inviting but rather freezing\u2014it \"froze your inside / froze your voice / froze your ears / froze your eyes / and froze your tongue.\" This metaphor highlights how the colonialist's laughter is harsh and dehumanizing, shutting down understanding and empathy, and symbolizing ignorance and derision.\n\nIn contrast, the African's laughter is described as \"the fire of the eye of the sky, the fire of the earth,\" which is warm, life-giving, and powerful enough to \"thaw\" the colonialist's frozen inside and senses. Thus, the \"ice-block laughter\" serves as a symbolic representation of the cold, dismissive, and ignorant attitude of the colonizer, which is ultimately overcome by the warmth and depth of African cultural pride and intellectualism.",

African poetry, especially from the postcolonial period, frequently addresses these issues.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. **Dennis Brutus** - Although sometimes mistakenly attributed with Okara's poem, Brutus himself was a prominent South African poet whose works often deal with colonialism, apartheid, and racial injustice.\n\n2. **Wole Soyinka** - His poetry and plays engage deeply with colonial and postcolonial Nigerian identity, cultural conflicts, and resistance to oppression.\n\n3. **Chinua Achebe** - While primarily known for his novels, Achebe's poetry and essays also reflect on colonial impact on African societies and the assertion of indigenous cultural pride.\n\n4. **David Diop** - A Senegalese poet whose works criticize colonialism and celebrate African heritage and identity.\n\nThese poets share with Okara a focus on cultural dignity, critique of colonial attitudes, and the affirmation of African identity. Their works, along with \"You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed,\" contribute to the rich tradition of African literature that challenges colonial narratives through powerful, evocative poetry.\n\nIn a broader sense, postcolonial literature worldwide often revisits similar themes of cultural clash, colonizer-colonized relationships, identity, and resistance. Therefore, exploring anthologies of African and postcolonial poetry will provide numerous works exploring related motifs to Okara's poem.",
