Validation failed for title: Mr. Lawrence
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Mr. Lawrence worked on which shows as a writer?', 'question': 'Mr. Lawrence worked on which shows as a writer?', 'answer': "Mr. Lawrence worked as a writer on Rocko's Modern Life, The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat, SpongeBob SquarePants, Hairballs, Do the Voice, Johnnie Talk, SpongeBob's Truth or Square, The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, The Twisted Whiskers Show, Lucky Lady, Mighty Magiswords, Wabbit, and Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling."}
Reason: The question is identical to the RAG_input, which is correct per requirement 2. However, the answer is not fully correct per the provided document. It lists items that are not shows or not writer credits (e.g., Hairballs is a short film; The Haunted World of El Superbeasto is a film; Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling credits him as Story Director rather than writer). While the document confirms writer credits on certain titles (e.g., Rocko's Modern Life; SpongeBob SquarePants; The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat; The Twisted Whiskers Show; SpongeBob's Truth or Square; Mighty Magiswords), the inclusion of non-shows or non-writer roles makes the answer incorrect with respect to requirement 3.

Validation failed for title: Mr. Lawrence
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did he direct any episodes of The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat?', 'question': "Given that Mr. Lawrence directed episodes of Rocko's Modern Life, did he also direct any episodes of The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat?", 'answer': 'Yes, Mr. Lawrence directed episodes of The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer states that Mr. Lawrence directed episodes of The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat, but the source documents list his roles mainly as writer/director for Rocko's Modern Life and do not confirm directing The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat. Therefore the Answer is not factually correct with respect to the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Lake Kariba
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does that compare to the Three Gorges Dam?', 'question': "How does Lake Kariba's storage capacity compare to the Three Gorges Dam's storage capacity?", 'answer': 'Lake Kariba is four times as large as the Three Gorges Dam.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer is not factually accurate. Lake Kariba's storage capacity is about 185 cubic kilometres, while the Three Gorges Dam's storage capacity is about 39 cubic kilometres, giving a ratio of roughly 4.7, not exactly 4. Therefore the 'four times as large' claim is incorrect.

Validation failed for title: Lake Kariba
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So you're not sure which lake we're talking about?", 'question': 'Are you unsure which lake we have been discussing?', 'answer': 'No, I am sure.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer contradicts the RAG_input. The RAG_input implies uncertainty about which lake is being discussed, and the corresponding Question asks if the speaker is unsure. The appropriate answer would reflect uncertainty (e.g., 'Yes, I am unsure.'), whereas the provided Answer states certainty ('No, I am sure.'), making it incorrect with respect to the given RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Subsistence agriculture
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'And what do they primarily provide to the herders?', 'question': 'And what do the reindeer raised in nomadic herding in arctic and sub-arctic regions primarily provide to the herders?', 'answer': 'The document mentions milk, skin, meat, and wool as products from animals raised in nomadic herding, but does not specify what reindeer primarily provide.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document' (violates rule 1: never mention a provided document). It also does not give a direct, standalone answer to the Question. A correct response would state the primary products of reindeer (e.g., meat and hides, with possible milk in some cultures) without citing a document.

Validation failed for title: Subsistence agriculture
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What animals do they typically herd?', 'question': 'What animals do the Bhotiyas and Gujjars of the Himalayas typically herd as part of their nomadic herding practices?', 'answer': 'The document does not explicitly state which animals the Bhotiyas and Gujjars specifically herd, but it generally mentions that nomadic herders rear cattle, sheep, goats, camels and / or yaks.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer should be self-contained and directly state the animals (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats, camels, and yaks) without referencing a document. It currently says 'The document does not explicitly state...' which violates rule 1, and it adds non-definitive phrasing.

Validation failed for title: AT HOP card
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So the first iteration of the HOP card could be used for things other than fares? Like what?', 'question': 'Given that Snapper initially supplied the first iteration of the HOP card, which could be used for minor transactions beyond transport fares, what specific types of transactions could that first HOP card be used for, other than paying for fares?', 'answer': 'The document does not explicitly state what other types of transactions the first HOP card could be used for.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer claims there is no explicit statement about other transaction types for the first HOP card. The context indicates the first HOP card could be used for minor transactions with merchants and retailers beyond transport fares, so the Answer is factually incorrect.

Validation failed for title: AT HOP card
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are the current AT HOP cards based on the same technology as the first iteration?', 'question': 'Given that the initial HOP card from Snapper was different from the later AT HOP card, are the current AT HOP cards based on the same underlying technology as the initial Snapper HOP card?', 'answer': "No, the current AT HOP cards are based on near field communication (NFC) with DESFire, while the technology of the first iteration is not specified but faced difficulties integrating with Thales' system.", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer asserts that the current AT HOP cards and the first HOP iteration use different underlying technologies, but the available data only states that current AT HOP uses NFC DESFire and that the first iteration's technology is not specified. There is not enough information to determine whether they are the same or different; the claim is not supported by the provided information.

Validation failed for title: Elephant in the room
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did Jimmy Durante contribute to the popularization of the phrase, if at all?', 'question': "Given the discussion about the origins and precursors to the phrase 'elephant in the room,' including Mark Twain's story, how did Jimmy Durante contribute to the popularization of the phrase, if he contributed at all?", 'answer': "In 1935, comedian Jimmy Durante starred on Broadway in the Billy Rose Broadway musical Jumbo, in which a police officer stops him while leading a live elephant and asks, 'What are you doing with that elephant?' Durante's reply, 'What elephant?' was a regular show-stopper. Durante reprises the piece in the 1962 film version of the play, Billy Rose 's Jumbo.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer incorrectly claims that Jimmy Durante contributed to popularizing the phrase. Historical usage predates Durante (e.g., Krylov's 1814 fable, Twain's 1882 story, and the 1959 NYT usage). Durante’s gag about 'What elephant?' in Jumbo is not considered a direct precursor to the modern idiom, so the answer is factually unsupported and not aligned with the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Elephant in the room
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "You mentioned Berkeley used the phrase 'invisible elephant.' How does that differ from the common understanding of the idiom today?", 'question': "Given the prior discussion on the origins of the 'elephant in the room' idiom, including mention of George Berkeley's use of the phrase 'invisible elephant,' how does Berkeley's usage and meaning of 'invisible elephant' differ from the common understanding of the 'elephant in the room' idiom today?", 'answer': "The document does not specify the difference between Berkeley's use of 'invisible elephant' and the modern idiom, but it implies that Berkeley used it in the context of debates with scientists about proving negative existential statements.", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it explicitly references a 'prior discussion' and 'origins' from earlier turns. A standalone rephrasing should be understandable without history or references to prior dialogue. This violates the requirement that the Question be self-contained while still reflecting the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What did the flag of Zaire look like?', 'question': 'Given that the flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo changed when the country was renamed Zaire, can you describe the appearance of the Zaire flag?', 'answer': "The flag of Zaire was created as part of Mobutu's attempted re-Africanization of the nation and was used officially until Mobutu's overthrow in the First Congo War.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not describe the appearance of the Zaire flag as asked by the rag_input. It provides historical context about Mobutu and timing instead of the flag's colors/design.

Validation failed for title: Russian Blue
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were they always called Russian Blue?', 'question': "Given that Russian Blue cats likely originate from the port of Arkhangel'sk in northern Russia, were they always called Russian Blue, or did they have a different original name?", 'answer': 'They are also sometimes called Archangel Blues. The first recorded appearance outside of Russia was in 1875 at The Crystal Palace in England as the Archangel Cat.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input; it adds origin context (Arkhangel'sk) not present in the rag_input, thus failing rule 2.

Validation failed for title: Russian Blue
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was there inbreeding?', 'question': 'Given that the Russian Blue cat breed was given its own class in 1912, was there any inbreeding or cross-breeding to develop the breed further?', 'answer': 'Right after the war , a lack of numbers of Russian Blues led to cross breeding with the Siamese . Although Russian Blues were in the United States before the war , it was not until the post-war period that American breeders created the modern Russian Blue that is seen in the United States today . This was done by combining the bloodlines of both the Scandinavian and British Russian Blues . The Siamese traits have now largely been bred out.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule 2 violation: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input; it adds extraneous context (the breed being given its own class in 1912) not present in the RAG_input, so it cannot be considered a faithful standalone restatement.

Validation failed for title: Russian Blue
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there other breeds used?', 'question': 'Besides potential inbreeding to refine the Russian Blue breed, were other cat breeds intentionally used to develop it further?', 'answer': 'Right after the war , a lack of numbers of Russian Blues led to cross breeding with the Siamese . Although Russian Blues were in the United States before the war , it was not until the post-war period that American breeders created the modern Russian Blue that is seen in the United States today . This was done by combining the bloodlines of both the Scandinavian and British Russian Blues . The Siamese traits have now largely been bred out. They have been used on a limited basis to create other breeds such as the Havana Brown or alter existing breeds such as the Nebelung.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided answer is factually incorrect and irrelevant to the Russian Blue breed. It asserts inbreeding in the Japanese imperial family, a claim with no basis in the RAG_input. It also fails to address whether other cat breeds were used to develop the Russian Blue (instead it introduces an unrelated topic), contradicting the documented history of cross-breeding with Siamese and other outcrosses.

Validation failed for title: Parens patriae
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give me a specific example of a parens patriae suit in the U.S.?', 'question': 'Following the explanation of parens patriae, can you provide a specific example of a parens patriae suit within the United States?', 'answer': 'The Hart - Scott - Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 (15 USC 15c), through Section 4C of the Clayton Act, permits state attorneys general to bring parens patriae suits on behalf of those injured by violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Another example is Massachusetts v. EPA, where states sued the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it references 'the explanation of parens patriae' from a prior turn. It must be a self-contained rephrase of the RAG_input without relying on history or mentioning an earlier explanation.

Validation failed for title: Nimbostratus cloud
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about subtypes of nimbostratus?', 'question': 'Given the differences between nimbostratus and cumulonimbus clouds, are there any subtypes of nimbostratus clouds?', 'answer': "Species and varieties : Nimbostratus is very thick , opaque , and featureless , so this genus type is not subdivided into species or varieties . Precipitation - based supplementary features : Nimbostratus is a major precipitation cloud and produces the virga or praecipitatio features . The latter can achieve heavy intensity due to the cloud 's vertical depth . Accessory cloud : Nimbostratus pannus is an accessory cloud of nimbostratus that forms as a ragged layer in precipitation below the main cloud deck.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. It introduces new context about 'differences between nimbostratus and cumulonimbus clouds,' which makes it non-self-contained and not a faithful rephrase of the original RAG_input ('What about subtypes of nimbostratus?'). This violates the requirement that the Question be a standalone, context-only restatement of the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Fynbos
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which river systems are important to the fynbos?', 'question': 'Considering the previous discussion about the fynbos ecosystem and its economic benefits, which river systems are particularly important to the fynbos region, and what role do they play?', 'answer': 'Five main river systems traverse the Cape floral kingdom : the Oliphants River of the Western Cape ; the Berg River which drains the West Coast Forelands plain stretching from the Cape Flats to the Olifants ; the Breede , which is the largest river on the Cape ; the Olifants River ( Southern Cape ) ; Gourits and the Groot Rivers which drain the Little Karoo basin and the South Coast Forelands ; and the Baviaanskloof and Gamtoos Rivers to the east.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer contains factual inconsistencies: it claims 'Five main river systems' but lists eight names; it duplicates Oliphants/Olifants (two different spellings for what may be the same river) and includes 'Groot Rivers' and 'Baviaanskloof' (the latter is more a watershed/region, not a river system). The list is not a coherent or accurate representation of the major river systems associated with the fynbos ecosystem, and the description does not clearly establish the river systems' ecological roles beyond generic drainage statements.

Validation failed for title: Fynbos
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there unique species in those river systems?', 'question': 'Given our discussion about the river systems within the fynbos region, are there any unique or endemic species of aquatic life that are found specifically within those river systems?', 'answer': 'Endemic species of fish in the five river systems occur in the area, too.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it relies on prior dialogue ('our discussion') and uses 'those river systems' without explicitly naming them. A proper stand-alone rephrase should be self-contained, e.g.: 'Are there any unique or endemic aquatic species specific to the river systems in the fynbos region?'

Validation failed for title: Context effect
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What other context effects are seen in marketing besides the compromise effect?', 'question': 'Besides the compromise effect, what other context effects are commonly observed in marketing?', 'answer': 'The attractiveness effect and the similarity effect are two other context effects researched in marketing. The attractiveness effect maintains that one item will increase the attractiveness of another item that is similar, but superior to it. The similarity effect states that an item will hurt a similar item more in sales than it will a dissimilar item.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer misdefines the attractiveness (attraction) effect. The attraction/decoy effect involves introducing a dominated option that is similar to the target and inferior, which increases the attractiveness of the target option. The statement that it increases the attractiveness of a similar, but superior, item is incorrect. The similarity effect description is largely correct, but the overall answer is not factually accurate.

Validation failed for title: Context effect
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Could you give an example of the similarity effect in action?', 'question': 'Given the explanation of the similarity effect in marketing, can you provide a real-world example of how it impacts sales?', 'answer': 'With two or more similar items competing for attention they will only detract from each other in the marketplace . Firms looking to increase product resale can use these context effects to construct more profitable marketing strategies .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it refers to 'the explanation' from prior turns, violating the requirement that the Question be self-contained. Additionally, the Answer does not provide a concrete real-world example as requested, offering only a generic statement about the similarity effect instead of a specific scenario.

Validation failed for title: Context effect
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So how can companies counteract the similarity effect?', 'question': 'Given that the similarity effect can negatively impact sales when similar products compete, what strategies can companies employ to mitigate this effect and improve the performance of their product lines?', 'answer': 'Firms looking to increase product resale can use these context effects to construct more profitable marketing strategies .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide concrete strategies to mitigate the similarity effect as requested by the Question. It is vague and generic about 'using context effects' without actionable approaches (e.g., product differentiation, pricing/assortment changes, messaging, or bundling). The Rag_input and Question are coherent and contextual, but the Answer fails to meet the requirement of offering specific, actionable mitigation strategies.

Validation failed for title: Context effect
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does the attractiveness effect differ from the similarity effect?', 'question': 'Both the attractiveness effect and the similarity effect influence consumer behavior. What are the key differences between these two marketing concepts?', 'answer': "The attractiveness effect , the second contextual effect on consumer behavior , maintains that one item will increase the attractiveness of another item that is similar , but superior to it . By showing that an item is superior to a similar one the likability and possible purchasing power of the superior item increases . The similarity effect , the third contextual effect on consumers ' behavior , states that an item will hurt a similar item more in sales than it will a dissimilar item . With two or more similar items competing for attention they will only detract from each other in the marketplace .", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer misdefines the attractiveness (attraction/decoy) effect. The decoy is dominated by the target (the decoy is worse than the target in all relevant aspects), which makes the target more attractive. The provided explanation describes the opposite—an item becoming more attractive to another item that is similar but superior— which is incorrect. Therefore, the Answer is not factually correct and does not accurately answer the comparative RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Beam bridge
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's an example of a viaduct that uses these continuous spans?", 'question': "You mentioned that beam bridges can be joined to create continuous spans to cross longer distances. What's an example of a viaduct that uses multiple, simply supported beam bridge spans?", 'answer': 'The Feiyunjiang Bridge in China.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone. It contains 'You mentioned...' which refers to prior dialogue, so it does not rephrase the RAG_input in a self-contained way as required. The Question should be a self-contained rephrase of the RAG_input without referencing previous turns.

Validation failed for title: Beam bridge
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does that compare to viaducts using continuous spans?', 'question': 'In the context of viaduct construction, how does using multiple simply supported spans like in the Feiyunjiang Bridge compare to using continuous spans over piers?', 'answer': 'This is opposed to viaducts using continuous spans over the piers.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrase of the RAG_input: it introduces a specific example (Feiyunjiang Bridge) that is not present in the RAG_input and assumes prior context, violating the requirement for a self-contained restatement. Additionally, the Answer is not a factual or complete response to the comparative prompt; it merely restates a contrast without providing substantive or correct comparative detail. For correctness, the Question should be a self-contained restatement of the RAG_input (e.g., sans specific prior examples), and the Answer should offer a precise, grounded comparison (e.g., explaining the implications of multiple simple spans versus continuous spans).

Validation failed for title: Cobalt-60
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are its primary applications?', 'question': 'Given that Cobalt-60 is produced in nuclear reactors, what are its primary applications?', 'answer': 'The main uses for Cobalt-60 are as a tracer for cobalt in chemical reactions, for sterilization of medical equipment, as a radiation source for medical radiotherapy (cobalt therapy), for industrial radiography, for leveling devices and thickness gauges, for pest insect sterilization, and as a radiation source for food irradiation and blood irradiation.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field must be exactly identical to the 'rag_input' for the first turn; here 'Question' is a rephrased version that adds contextual text ('Given that Cobalt-60 is produced in nuclear reactors'), so it does not match the required exact match.

Validation failed for title: Cold feet
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is there much research on this phenomenon?', 'question': "Given that the UCLA study links pre-marital doubt to divorce, is there a significant amount of research available on the 'cold feet' phenomenon in general?", 'answer': "Original research on the 'cold feet' phenomenon is very limited and warrants further studies.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer claims that original research on the 'cold feet' phenomenon is 'very limited.' However, there is substantive research on premarital doubt and its implications for marriage (e.g., the UCLA four-year study) and additional peer-reviewed work (e.g., 2012 Journal of Family Psychology). Therefore, the assertion of very limited research is not accurate.

Validation failed for title: Cold feet
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Besides marriage, are there other common situations where people get cold feet?', 'question': "Given that 'cold feet,' linking to pre-marital doubt and limited research, is associated with marriage, are there other frequently encountered scenarios where individuals experience 'cold feet'?", 'answer': "The document defines 'cold feet' as apprehension or doubt strong enough to prevent a planned course of action. A loss or lack of courage or confidence; an onset of uncertainty or fear. To `` have cold feet '' is to be too fearful to undertake or complete an action. A wave of timidity or fearfulness. Loss or lack of courage or confidence. Timidity that prevents the continuation of a course of action. While marriage is a common example, it doesn't list other common uses.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the standalone Question about contexts besides marriage. It only provides a general definition of 'cold feet' and notes that marriage is a common example, without listing or describing any other scenarios, thus failing to provide a correct and relevant answer.

Validation failed for title: My Name Is Human
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'No, I mean specifically for rock music. Which rock-related Billboard charts did it appear on?', 'question': "Which rock-related Billboard charts did the song 'My Name Is Human' appear on?", 'answer': 'US Alternative Songs, US Hot Rock Songs, and US Rock Airplay', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The answer lists US Alternative Songs, US Hot Rock Songs, and US Rock Airplay but omits US Mainstream Rock, where the song also charted (reaching No. 1). Since the question asks for rock-related Billboard charts, Mainstream Rock is relevant and should be included.

Validation failed for title: Phase (matter)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What determines which phases are possible for a given substance?', 'question': 'Considering that distinct phases can exist within the same state of matter, as illustrated by crystal phases in solids and immiscible liquids, what factors determine the specific phases that can occur for a particular substance under given conditions?', 'answer': 'For a given composition, only certain phases are possible at a given temperature and pressure. The number and type of phases that will form is hard to predict and is usually determined by experiment.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer is incomplete/partially incorrect. It mentions composition, temperature, and pressure but omits other crucial determinants (impurities/solutes, kinetics, presence of interfaces, phase diagrams, Gibbs phase rule, and thermodynamics governing phase stability). It also asserts that the number and type of phases are 'hard to predict' and usually determined by experiment, which is overly vague; many systems can be predicted from thermodynamics and phase diagrams rather than relying solely on trial-and-error experimentation.

Validation failed for title: Cold feet
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is it mostly used in the context of marriage?', 'question': "Given the definition of 'cold feet' as apprehension before an action, and its first appearances in the 17th century, is the phrase mostly used in the context of marriage, or are there other common applications?", 'answer': "A common use of the phrase is when people fear the commitment of marriage and get `` cold feet '' before a wedding ceremony . This pre-marital doubt or fear may manifest for a variety of reasons and sometimes cause the bride or groom to back out of a planned marriage.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The RAG_input asks whether 'cold feet' is mostly used in the context of marriage or whether there are other common applications. The provided Answer only discusses marriage and does not address other contexts or provide a comparative assessment. It should acknowledge that while marriage is a common context, the phrase is also used more broadly to describe hesitation before various actions and should explicitly compare usage across contexts.

Validation failed for title: Cold feet
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did that UCLA study have a title?', 'question': "Given that a four-year UCLA study found a correlation between pre-marital doubt ('cold feet') and future marital problems, does the document mention the title of that specific study?", 'answer': 'Do Cold Feet Warn of Trouble Ahead ? Premarital Uncertainty and Four - Year Marital Outcomes', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule 2 violation: The Question refers to 'the document' rather than being a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. It should be self-contained and not mention documents, sources, or retrieval processes. The Question should simply restate the prompt 'Did that UCLA study have a title?' in a self-contained way.

Validation failed for title: Doctor of Physical Therapy
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is the GRE always required?', 'question': 'When applying to Doctor of Physical Therapy programs, is the GRE (Graduate Record Examinations) test always required or can some programs waive it?', 'answer': "A bachelor 's degree generally is required before beginning a Doctor of Physical Therapy program , but there is no requirement on the degree earned , as long as all prerequisite course requirements are met .", 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The provided Answer does not address whether the GRE is always required or can be waived for DPT programs; it only mentions the bachelor’s degree prerequisite, not GRE requirements.

Validation failed for title: Ozark (TV series)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What kind of strange interests does Jonah develop?', 'question': 'You mentioned that Jonah Byrde develops strange interests after his family moves to the Ozarks in the TV series Ozark. What kind of strange interests does Jonah develop?', 'answer': 'Jonah Byrde begins to show strange interests in dead animals and guns.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it relies on prior dialogue by saying 'You mentioned...' and thus does not rephrase the RAG_input in a self-contained way. A valid stand-alone version should remove references to previous turns and explicitly contextualize (e.g., 'In the Ozark TV series, what kind of strange interests does Jonah Byrde develop after his family moves to the Ozarks?').

Validation failed for title: Ozark (TV series)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Does the show depict how he explores these interests?', 'question': 'In the TV series Ozark, the character Jonah Byrde develops an interest in dead animals and guns. Does the show depict how he explores these interests?', 'answer': "The provided document doesn't detail how the show depicts Jonah's exploration of these interests.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not directly address whether the show depicts Jonah's exploration of his interests and instead refers to a document. According to the rules, the Answer must be a self-contained factual response about the question (Yes/No with a brief justification) and must not mention external documents.

Validation failed for title: Ozark (TV series)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give me a specific example of how he interacts with dead animals?', 'question': 'In the TV series Ozark, Jonah Byrde has a fascination with dead animals. Can you give me a specific example of how he interacts with dead animals in the show?', 'answer': 'The provided document does not give specific examples of how Jonah interacts with dead animals.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide a concrete example and instead asserts that the document lacks information; it references a document, which violates the rules. The Answer should be a standalone, factual example of how Jonah interacts with dead animals, drawn from the RAG_input/Question context, not meta-information about sources.

Validation failed for title: Ozark (TV series)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about his interest in guns? Can you tell me more about that?', 'question': 'In the TV series Ozark, Jonah Byrde develops an interest in guns. Can you tell me more about his interest in guns in the show?', 'answer': "The provided document doesn't contain specific details about Jonah's interest in guns.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide a standalone factual response about Jonah's interest in guns; it simply states that a document lacks information and references that document, which violates the requirement to be self-contained and answer the question.

Validation failed for title: Andre Gunder Frank
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What were the core differences in their conclusions?', 'question': "In the 1998 debate between Andre Gunder Frank and David Landes about the long view significance of economic developments in 'the West' during the modern era, what were the core differences in their conclusions?", 'answer': "The document doesn't specify the core differences in their conclusions, only that they came to very different conclusions.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the standalone Question with the core differences. It merely states that the conclusions differed, without providing or summarizing those differences. The requirement is to give a factual, relevant answer to the question (or an appropriate note if unknown), not to assert lack of specification.

Validation failed for title: Hung jury
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are Allen charges used everywhere in the US?', 'question': 'Following the explanation of what an Allen charge is, are Allen charges used in all jurisdictions within the United States?', 'answer': 'Some jurisdictions permit the court to give the jury a so - called Allen charge , inviting the dissenting jurors to re-examine their opinions , as a last - ditch effort to prevent the jury from hanging .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone: it references 'Following the explanation of what an Allen charge is,' which relies on prior turns. A standalone rephrase should be understandable without history and not reference previous discussion.

Validation failed for title: Hung jury
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What happens if a jury deadlocks in a death penalty case?', 'question': 'In the United States, what is the procedure if a jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision in a death penalty case?', 'answer': 'Of the 31 U.S. states with the death penalty , 29 provide the sentence to be decided by a jury , and 28 require a unanimous sentence . However , the states differ on what happens if the penalty phase results in a hung jury : In 4 states ( Arizona , California , Kentucky and Nevada ) , a retrial of the penalty phase will be conducted before a different jury ( the common - law rule for mistrial ) . In 2 states ( Indiana and Missouri ) , the judge will decide the sentence . In the 22 other states , a hung jury results in a life sentence , even if only one juror opposed death . Federal law also provides that outcome .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer contains factual inaccuracies and over-generalizations about hung jury rules in U.S. death-penalty cases. The stated counts (e.g., 31 states with the death penalty; 29/28 requiring specific outcomes) and the specific outcomes by state (retrial, judge-decided, or life sentence) are not uniformly correct across all jurisdictions and may be outdated or incorrect. Therefore it does not meet the requirement to be factually correct.

Validation failed for title: Life in a Northern Town
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did it win any?', 'question': 'Did the Sugarland cover of "Life in a Northern Town" win any of the awards for which it was nominated?', 'answer': 'The document does not state whether it won any of the awards.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer contains 'The document does not state...' which references a source, violating the 'Never mention that a document was provided' rule, and it does not provide a direct, factual answer to whether Sugarland's cover won any awards. The expected answer would be a direct statement (e.g., 'No, it did not win any of the awards for which it was nominated.'), assuming no wins are recorded in the context.

Validation failed for title: London Bridge (Lake Havasu City)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who bought it?', 'question': 'Who bought the London Bridge and moved it to Lake Havasu City, Arizona?', 'answer': 'Robert P. McCulloch purchased the London Bridge from the City of London.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Two issues: (a) The Question is not a faithful standalone rephrase of rag_input. Rag_input is 'Who bought it?', but the Question adds 'and moved it to Lake Havasu City, Arizona,' introducing information not present in the rag_input and making it not a direct standalone rephrase. (b) The Answer does not fully address the standalone Question, as it only mentions the purchase and omits the relocation/move to Lake Havasu City, Arizona, which the Question asks about.

Validation failed for title: Dilip Joshi
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Wait, I meant the acting role, not the award.', 'question': "Clarifying my previous question about Dilip Joshi's acting roles before Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, I was asking which of his acting roles (Gujarati dramas, Hindi television serials, or films) came first, not which award he received first.", 'answer': 'According to the document, Maine Pyar Kiya was his first film role, and the document does not specify the dates of his Gujarati dramas or Hindi television serials relative to that film.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The Answer incorrectly states that Maine Pyar Kiya was Dilip Joshi's first acting role; he had prior Gujarati drama work, so the earliest acting role type would be Gujarati dramas, not films. Additionally, the Answer references 'the document,' which violates the rule to not mention any document in the response.

Validation failed for title: Dilip Joshi
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'But I thought he did Gujarati dramas before that?', 'question': "Considering the previous discussion about Dilip Joshi's acting roles prior to Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, is it not the case that he was involved in Gujarati dramas before his role in the television serial Shubh Mangal Savadhan?", 'answer': 'Yes, he did Gujarati dramas before Shubh Mangal Savadhan. The document mentions he appeared in several Gujarati dramas.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document' as a source, which violates the rule to not mention that a document was provided. The Answer should be self-contained and not rely on or cite external documents.

Validation failed for title: Aviation photography
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Is that different from how you'd plan for ground-to-air shots?", 'question': 'Given that military air-to-air aviation photography requires specific planning of aircraft placement relative to the sun for optimal lighting, is the lighting planning process significantly different for ground-to-air aviation photography?', 'answer': 'In ground - to - air photography , photos of aircraft in flight are taken with the photographer on the ground . This type of photography is common at airshows or airports . Generally , a long focus photographic lens is necessary due to the greater distance between the photographer and the target aircraft .', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the comparative lighting planning question; it only describes general ground-to-air photography (setup and lens) and does not explain whether lighting planning differs between air-to-air and ground-to-air shots.

Validation failed for title: Aviation photography
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, it's mostly about timing and positioning?", 'question': "Given that the type of lens doesn't seem to significantly affect lighting considerations in air-to-air military aviation photography, is achieving proper lighting primarily a matter of timing and positioning of the aircraft relative to the sun?", 'answer': 'Proper lighting is achieved through correct placement of the aircraft relative to the sun, and is accomplished flying only at certain times of the day and / or by flying at a heading that lines the sun up on the subject aircraft properly .', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. The RAG_input is 'So, it's mostly about timing and positioning?' while the Question adds extraneous context about lens effects and expands content beyond the original, violating the requirement that the Question be a self-contained rephrase of the RAG_input. It also introduces a new claim about lens influence that isn’t present in the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Safe Haven (film)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did he direct any other films based on Nicholas Sparks novels?', 'question': 'Besides Safe Haven, did Lasse Hallström direct any other films based on novels by Nicholas Sparks?', 'answer': 'No, Safe Haven is the only Nicholas Sparks novel adaptation directed by Lasse Hallström, according to the document.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer claims that Safe Haven is the only Nicholas Sparks adaptation directed by Lasse Hallström. The document also lists Dear John (2010) as another Nicholas Sparks adaptation directed by Hallström, so the answer is not factually correct.

Validation failed for title: Safe Haven (film)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who are the main actors in the film?', 'question': 'Safe Haven is a romantic drama thriller. Who are the main actors in Safe Haven?', 'answer': 'The main actors in Safe Haven are Julianne Hough, Josh Duhamel, and Cobie Smulders.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input; it should be a standalone rephrasing that adds context and does not repeat the exact RAG_input. It also should follow on from the prior turn (context-aware), not merely restate the question.

Validation failed for title: William Horman
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, in the Apologeticon, did he focus on Whittington's Latin style or his pedagogical theories?", 'question': "Given that William Horman wrote the Apologeticon to directly engage with Robert Whittington's criticisms after Whittington attacked Horman's teaching methods, did Horman's Apologeticon primarily focus on critiquing Whittington's Latin style or on dissecting and refuting his pedagogical theories regarding grammar instruction?", 'answer': "In his Apologeticon contra Rob. Whittingtoni Protova tis Angliæ incivilem indoctamque criminationem , he dissected some of Whittington 's poetry and treated it to severe criticism.", 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer does not clearly resolve the requested focus. The Question asks whether Horman's Apologeticon primarily targeted Whittington's Latin style or his pedagogical theories. The provided Answer only states that Horman dissected Whittington's poetry and offered severe criticism, without explicitly indicating which of the two options was the primary focus. A definitive choice between 'Latin style' and 'pedagogical theories' is missing.

Validation failed for title: Accounting rate of return
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give an example of how depreciation can affect ARR?', 'question': 'Given that the Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) is based on accounting profits and can be influenced by non-cash items like depreciation, can you provide a specific example illustrating how changes in depreciation methods can affect the calculated ARR?', 'answer': 'The document states "The ARR is built on evaluation of profits and it can be easily manipulated with changes in depreciation methods ."', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide a concrete example illustrating how depreciation methods affect ARR. It merely restates a general claim about ARR and depreciation without a specific scenario or numbers. A valid answer should include a concrete example (e.g., comparing ARR under different depreciation methods with explicit profits, investments, and resulting ARR).

Validation failed for title: Benedict's reagent
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How about starches?', 'question': "Similar to sucrose, how does Benedict's reagent react with starches in terms of detection?", 'answer': "Starches do not react or react very poorly with Benedict's reagent, due to the relatively small number of reducing sugar moieties, which occur only at the ends of carbohydrate chains.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input. rag_input is 'How about starches?' which is vague and relies on prior context. The Question adds context about 'Similar to sucrose' and Benedict's reagent, making it non-self-contained and not a faithful restatement of the rag_input. This violates the requirement that the Question be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input. (The Answer is factually correct, but the validation fails due to this mismatch.)

Validation failed for title: Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was it a hit?', 'question': 'Referring to Ralph Flanagan and His Orchestra\'s recording of "Joshua", released by RCA Victor Records and EMI on the His Master\'s Voice label, was it a commercially successful recording?', 'answer': "The document doesn't say whether it was a hit.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer refers to a document ('The document doesn't say...'), which violates the requirement that the Answer be self-contained and not mention whether a document was provided. A correct answer would state that there is insufficient information to determine whether the recording was commercially successful, without referencing sources.

Validation failed for title: Textile industry in India
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "How does that compare to the cotton sector's contribution?", 'question': "What is the percentage of India's total cloth production from the cotton sector, and how does that compare to the 13% contribution from the handloom sector?", 'answer': 'The cotton sector is the second most developed sector in the Indian Textile industries.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide the required numeric percentage for the cotton sector nor a direct comparison to the handloom sector's 13% contribution. The RAG_input / Question expect a quantitative comparison (e.g., 'X% vs 13%'), whereas the provided Answer only states a qualitative claim about development level and is not tied to the requested percentage.

Validation failed for title: Textile industry in India
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, is man-made fibre production growing or shrinking?', 'question': "Given that man-made fibres account for 62% of India's total textile production, is the production volume of man-made fibres in India currently increasing or decreasing?", 'answer': "The strong domestic demand and the revival of the Economic markets by 2009 has led to huge growth of the Indian textile industry . In December 2010 , the domestic cotton price was up by 50 % as compared to the December 2009 prices . The causes behind high cotton price are due to the floods in Pakistan and China . India projected a high production of textile ( 325 lakh bales for 2010 - 11 ) . There has been increase in India 's share of global textile trading to seven percent in five years . The rising prices are the major concern of the domestic producers of the country .", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer does not state whether man-made fibre production is growing or shrinking. It provides unrelated context about the textile sector and cotton prices rather than a direct trend assessment for man-made fibres. Additionally, the Question introduces a 62% figure not present in the rag_input, making it not a faithful standalone rephrase of the original input.

Validation failed for title: Textile industry in India
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What makes it seasonal?', 'question': "Given that the cotton sector's employment in India is seasonal, what are the primary factors that cause this seasonal variation in employment?", 'answer': 'Availability of raw materials , market , transport , labour , moist climate and other factors contributed to localisation.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: RAG_input, Question, and Type are valid. The Answer, however, does not directly address the standalone Question about the primary factors driving seasonal variation in cotton-sector employment. It reproduces a sentence about localisation and lists several factors, but it fails to clearly identify the specific factors that cause seasonality in employment.

Validation failed for title: Hydrate
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there other molecules besides ethanol that can be considered hydrates in organic chemistry?', 'question': 'Given that ethanol is considered a hydrate of ethene, are there other organic molecules, besides ethanol and ethene, that are also classified as hydrates?', 'answer': 'Yes, another example is chloral hydrate, CCl3-CH(OH)2, which can be formed by reaction of water with chloral, CCl3-CH=O.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the 'rag_input'. It adds context by stating that ethanol is a hydrate of ethene and asks about hydrates besides both ethanol and ethene, which changes the scope and makes it not equivalent to the original prompt. A proper standalone rephrase should simply ask about other hydrates besides ethanol without referencing ethene or prior context.

Validation failed for title: General Hospital cast members
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was she the only one?', 'question': 'Besides Patty McCormack, who else played Monica Quartermaine in 2018 on General Hospital?', 'answer': 'No, Leslie Charleson also played Monica Quartermaine in 2018.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided Answer is factually incorrect: both Leslie Charleson and Patty McCormack played Monica Quartermaine in 2018. Additionally, the Question is identical to the rag_input, which violates the requirement that the Question must be a standalone rephrasing (not identical to the rag_input).

Validation failed for title: General Hospital cast members
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So Leslie Charleson didn't play her at all that year?", 'question': 'Are you saying that Leslie Charleson did not portray the character Monica Quartermaine on General Hospital at any point during the year 2018?', 'answer': 'No, Leslie Charleson also played Monica Quartermaine in 2018.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer is incomplete/wrong: in 2018, Monica Quartermaine was portrayed by both Leslie Charleson and Patty McCormack (as a temporary replacement). The provided Answer only mentions Leslie Charleson and omits Patty McCormack, making it not fully correct.

Validation failed for title: General Hospital cast members
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So Leslie Charleson wasn't on the show in 2018?", 'question': 'Are you claiming that Leslie Charleson, who has played Monica Quartermaine for a long time, was not on General Hospital at all during 2018?', 'answer': 'Leslie Charleson was also on the show in 2018 playing Monica Quartermaine.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer omits Patty McCormack's temporary portrayal of Monica Quartermaine in 2018; the correct response should acknowledge that Monica was played by both Leslie Charleson and Patty McCormack that year. The Question is a valid Clarification rephrase of the rag_input, but the Answer is not fully accurate.

Validation failed for title: Sadness
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there specific brain areas associated with feeling sad?', 'question': 'Given the discussion of sadness and coping mechanisms, are there specific brain areas associated with feeling sad?', 'answer': "Sadness has been found to be associated with increases in bilateral activity within the vicinity of the middle and posterior temporal cortex , lateral cerebellum , cerebellar vermis , midbrain , putamen , and caudate . Increased brain activity has been observed in the bilateral inferior and orbitofrontal cortex , prefrontal cortex , in the region called Brodmann 's area 9 , and the thalamus and in the bilateral anterior temporal structures.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided Question relies on prior discussion ('the discussion of sadness and coping mechanisms') and is not a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input. It fails the requirement that Question be standalone and understandable without history. The RAG_input is contextually connected, and the Answer is factually correct, and Type is appropriate, but the standalone requirement for the Question is not met.

Validation failed for title: Sadness
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What vocal patterns are associated with sadness?', 'question': 'Considering that pupil size and brain activity are connected to sadness, are there also distinct vocal patterns that characterize the expression of sadness?', 'answer': 'Sadness is communicated mostly by lowering the mean and variability of the fundamental frequency ( f ) , besides being associated with lower vocal intensity , and with decreases in f over time . when someone is sad , slow , low pitched speech with weak high audio frequency energy is produced . Likewise , low energy state of sadness attributes to slow tempo , lower speech rate and mean pitch .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it adds extraneous context about pupil size and brain activity and does not rephrase the RAG_input 'What vocal patterns are associated with sadness?' as a self-contained question. It should be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input without referencing prior turns.

Validation failed for title: Chop Suey! (song)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are you sure? He mentions something about drug abuse and angels.', 'question': "Earlier I asked what the song 'Chop Suey!' is about, according to Daron Malakian. You said there was no information. Are you sure? Does Daron Malakian mention anything about drug abuse and angels in relation to the song's meaning?", 'answer': "Yes, Daron Malakian explained, 'The song is about how we are regarded differently depending on how we pass . Everyone deserves to die . Like , if I were now to die from drug abuse , they might say I deserved it because I abused dangerous drugs . Hence the line , ' I cry when angels deserve to die ' .'", 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input; it relies on prior conversation context (references to 'Earlier I asked...') and thus is not self-contained. A valid Question would be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input without history references.

Validation failed for title: Chop Suey! (song)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, what *does* he say the line 'I cry when angels deserve to die' means?", 'question': "What explanation does Daron Malakian give for the meaning of the line 'I cry when angels deserve to die' in the song 'Chop Suey!'?", 'answer': "Hence the line, 'I cry when angels deserve to die' .", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide Daron Malakian's explanation for the meaning of the line. It merely references the line itself rather than explaining what he said about its meaning (e.g., about judging people based on how they pass and the idea that 'everyone deserves to die').

Validation failed for title: Chop Suey! (song)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Doesn't it mention Jesus?", 'question': "Does the Wikipedia article about the song 'Chop Suey!' mention any connection between the song's lyrics and the death of Jesus?", 'answer': "Yes, the lyric passages 'Father, into your hands I commend my spirit' and 'why have you forsaken me?' are a reference to Jesus' death on the cross, as, according to the Gospels, it was one of the seven things Jesus said while dying.", 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. It introduces an external reference to 'the Wikipedia article,' which treats it as a document. Per the rules, the Question must be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input without referring to any document.

Validation failed for title: National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What specific data was Kelley supposed to collect?', 'question': 'President Andrew Johnson commissioned Oliver Kelley to go to the Southern states. What specific data was Kelley supposed to collect when he went to the Southern states?', 'answer': 'Kelley was commissioned to collect data to improve Southern agricultural conditions.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The previous turn did not rephrase the provided RAG_input as a standalone Question. It introduced new context (the National Grange founding and who commissioned Kelley) and altered the topic, rather than strictly rephrasing 'What specific data was Kelley supposed to collect?' as a self-contained follow-up. This deviates from the required format and content.

Validation failed for title: National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did he overcome them?', 'question': 'President Andrew Johnson commissioned Oliver Kelley to go to the Southern states to improve Southern agricultural conditions. Assuming Kelley faced challenges, how did he overcome them?', 'answer': 'With Southern Masons as guides , he toured the war - torn countryside in the South and was appalled by the outdated farming practices . He saw the need for an organization that would bring people from the North and South together in a spirit of mutual cooperation', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrase of the RAG_input; it introduces extra context (Andrew Johnson, Kelley’s commissioning) that is not present in the RAG_input, violating the requirement that the Question should be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Stratovolcano
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What makes them so dangerous?', 'question': 'Given that stratovolcanoes are more common than shield volcanoes, what characteristics make stratovolcanoes so dangerous?', 'answer': 'In recorded history , explosive eruptions at subduction zone ( convergent - boundary ) volcanoes have posed the greatest hazard to civilizations . Subduction - zone stratovolcanoes , such as Mount St. Helens , Mount Etna and Mount Pinatubo , typically erupt with explosive force : the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases . As a consequence , the tremendous internal pressures of the trapped volcanic gases remain in the pasty magma . Following the breaching of the magma chamber , the magma degasses explosively . The gases and water gush out with speed and force .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input does not clearly build on the prior turn; 'What makes them so dangerous?' is ambiguous without prior context. The prompt must be contextually connected to the previous turn, but this RAG_input is not sufficiently tied to prior discussion, making it not standalone-ready.

Validation failed for title: Sperm motility
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about the causes of non-motile sperm?', 'question': 'Considering the classifications of sperm motility which include straight moving, zig-zag moving, vibrating, and non-motile sperm, what are the potential causes of sperm being non-motile?', 'answer': 'Insufficient sperm motility is a common cause of subfertility or infertility. Sperm DNA damage is common in infertile men. About 31% of men with sperm motility defects have high levels of sperm DNA fragmentation.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided Answer does not directly list or explain potential causes of non-motile sperm. It states that 'insufficient sperm motility' is a common cause of subfertility, which is tautological and not a causal explanation for non-motility. It also cites a DNA fragmentation statistic without clearly linking it as a cause of non-motility. A correct answer should enumerate concrete etiologies (e.g., flagellar defects, energy/metabolism issues, calcium signaling, oxidative stress, infections, thermal effects/varicocele, lifestyle factors) and relate them specifically to non-motility.

Validation failed for title: Sperm motility
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What measures can be taken to improve sperm quality?', 'question': 'Given that sperm DNA damage is related to sperm motility, and that classifications of sperm motility include straight moving, zig-zag moving, vibrating, and non-motile, what specific measures can be taken to improve sperm quality, including addressing DNA damage and motility issues?', 'answer': 'Several measures are available to improve sperm quality.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is too generic and does not clearly build on the prior turn (rule 1). It should reference previously discussed DNA damage or motility classifications to be a follow-up. The Question adds contextual details not strictly derived from the RAG_input, which violates the requirement that it be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. The Answer is also overly vague and does not enumerate concrete measures expected for improving sperm quality as asked (rule 4).

Validation failed for title: Sperm motility
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about technological interventions?', 'question': 'Considering that sperm DNA damage impacts motility classifications like straight moving, zig-zag moving, vibrating, and non-motile and that lifestyle changes and medical interventions can help, are there any technological interventions that can improve sperm motility when DNA damage is a factor?', 'answer': 'Without technological intervention, a non-motile or abnormally - motile sperm is not going to fertilize.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the requested topic of technological interventions to improve sperm motility when DNA damage is a factor; it merely restates that non-motile sperm cannot fertilize without intervention, which is not a substantive or specific answer to the follow-up. The response should discuss or list technological/assisted approaches (e.g., ART options like ICSI, sperm selection technologies, lab-based interventions) relevant to motility and DNA damage.

Validation failed for title: Veil of ignorance
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Has this concept been used or discussed by other philosophers?', 'question': 'Besides John Rawls, have other philosophers used or discussed the concept of the veil of ignorance, or similar ideas, in their work?', 'answer': 'The concept of the veil of ignorance has been in use by other names for centuries by philosophers such as John Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kant whose work discussed the concept of the social contract. John Harsanyi helped to formalize the concept in economics, and argued that it provides an argument in favor of utilitarianism rather than an argument for a social contract.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer contains factual inaccuracies. The veil of ignorance is attributed to John Rawls (1971) and is best understood as part of his original position. While there are precursors and related ideas within the broader social contract tradition, philosophers like Mill and Kant did not formulate or explicitly discuss the veil of ignorance as Rawls terms it. Harsanyi did formalize a similar idea in economics, but the claim that Mill and Kant discussed the concept under the label of the veil of ignorance (or that it existed under ‘centuries’ of prior use) is incorrect. A more accurate answer would situate the veil of ignorance with Rawls, acknowledge related contractual ideas in Hobbes/Locke/Rousseau/Kant, and note Harsanyi’s utilitarian justification behind a veil-of-ignorance framework.

Validation failed for title: Spirit of Ecstasy
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'I thought you said it was on display at the National Motor Museum?', 'question': "Earlier in this conversation, you mentioned 'The Whisper,' which was based on Eleanor Velasco Thornton and predates the Spirit of Ecstasy. Considering this, am I mistaken in recalling that you stated 'The Whisper' is on display at the National Motor Museum?", 'answer': 'Yes, it is on display at the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The Question does not faithfully rephrase the RAG_input as a standalone restatement. It introduces additional context about 'The Whisper' and Eleanor Velasco Thornton, extending beyond the simple claim in the RAG_input ('I thought you said it was on display at the National Motor Museum?'). Therefore it fails the Standalone rephrase requirement. A correct Question would restate the exact concern about the display status without adding unrelated details.

Validation failed for title: 416 Fire
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How large did it get?', 'question': 'What was the final size of the 416 Fire?', 'answer': 'By July 1, the fire had grown to 49,301 acres (19,951 ha). As of July 2, 2018 the fires have burned a combined total of over 55,000 acres (22,258 ha).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer cites 49,301 acres as of July 1 for the 416 Fire, but then adds that by July 2 the fires together exceeded 55,000 acres. The 55,000-acre figure is a combined total for the 416 Fire and the Burro Fire, not the final size of the 416 Fire alone. The Question asks for the final size of the 416 Fire by itself; the solo figure should be the 416 Fire's size (approximately 49,301 acres by July 1, 2018) rather than the combined total.

Validation failed for title: Oncogene
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's the MYC gene involved in?", 'question': 'You mentioned some examples of proto-oncogenes, including MYC. What is the MYC gene involved in?', 'answer': "The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt's lymphoma. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone. It relies on prior conversation by stating 'You mentioned some examples of proto-oncogenes, including MYC,' which makes it not self-contained. A valid Question should rephrase the rag_input in a self-contained way without referencing previous turns.

Validation failed for title: Oncogene
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there other ways proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes besides chromosomal translocation?', 'question': 'Besides chromosomal translocation leading to increased expression of genes like MYC, are there other mechanisms by which a proto-oncogene can be activated to become an oncogene?', 'answer': 'Yes, there are other ways. A mutation within a proto-oncogene or its regulatory region can cause a change in protein structure, leading to increased activity or loss of regulation. Also, an increase in the amount of a certain protein (protein concentration) caused by increased protein expression or mRNA stability, or gene duplication, can lead to a proto-oncogene becoming an oncogene.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone, self-contained restatement of the rag_input. It adds an example ('genes like MYC') and references chromosomal translocation context, which introduces extraneous detail not present in the rag_input. The Question should be a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input without extra examples or prior-context references.

Validation failed for title: Oncogene
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give me an example of a cancer caused by gene duplication of a proto-oncogene?', 'question': 'What is an example of a specific type of cancer that is caused by gene duplication of a proto-oncogene, resulting in increased protein production?', 'answer': 'The document does not provide a specific example of a cancer caused by gene duplication of a proto-oncogene.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer is not factually correct. There are cancers associated with proto-oncogene amplification/gene duplication, such as HER2/ERBB2 amplification in breast cancer, which leads to increased oncoprotein production. Therefore, the provided answer fails to be accurate or relevant to the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Irrigation tank
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there different types of tanks used for irrigation?', 'question': "Given that we've discussed the advantages and disadvantages of tank irrigation in South India, are there different types or categories of tanks used for this purpose?", 'answer': 'The document mentions village tanks, temple tanks (Pushkarni, Kalyani, Kund), and stepwells (bavdi, bavli). It also mentions modern tank management and artificial wetlands.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: 1) RAG_input is not clearly building on the prior turn and reads as a standalone, lacking the South India context. 2) Question is not standalone; it references prior discussion, making it not self-contained. 3) Answer refers to 'the document,' which violates the rule of not mentioning that a document was provided.

Validation failed for title: Irrigation tank
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any examples of successful tank regeneration projects?', 'question': 'Given the discussion on tank irrigation in South India and the problem of silting, are there any specific examples of successful tank regeneration or restoration projects that have effectively addressed the silting issue and improved irrigation outcomes?', 'answer': "Ralegaon Siddhi is an example of a village that revitalised its ancient tank system. In 1975 the village was drought - stricken. The village tank could not hold water as the earthen embankment dam wall leaked. Work began with the percolation tank construction by the villagers who donated their labor to repair the embankment. Once this was fixed, the village 's seven wells below the tank filled with water in the summer for the first time in memory. Now the village has a supply of water throughout the year.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is not clearly building on the prior turn and is too generic. It lacks the South India context and the silting issue that the previous turn discussed, failing the requirement that the rag_input be contextually connected to prior conversation.

Validation failed for title: Bennet Omalu
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was that before or after his fellowship in Seattle?', 'question': "Was Bennet Omalu's residency at Columbia University's Harlem Hospital Center before or after his fellowship in Seattle?", 'answer': 'It was after his fellowship in Seattle.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question field must be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input, not identical to it. In the provided turn, 'Question' is identical to 'rag_input', which violates the requirement to rewrite the rag_input into a self-contained, contextually rephrased question.

Validation failed for title: Bennet Omalu
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did he get any other degrees afterwards?', 'question': "After becoming interested in neuropathology and completing his training as a forensic pathologist at the Allegheny County Coroner's Office in Pittsburgh, did Bennet Omalu obtain any further advanced degrees or board certifications?", 'answer': 'Yes, Omalu received fellowships in pathology and neuropathology, a Master of Public Health, and a Master of Business Administration.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer mentions fellowships (not degrees or board certifications) and lists MPH and MBA, but it does not mention Bennet Omalu's board certifications. The question asks for any further advanced degrees or board certifications after his residency; a complete answer should include MPH, MBA, and his board certifications (e.g., in pathology/neuropathology).

Validation failed for title: Mach Five
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did any of the remakes keep all the original functions?', 'question': 'Considering the design changes in the various remakes and adaptations of Speed Racer, did any of them retain all of the original functions of the Mach Five as seen in the original 1967 series?', 'answer': 'No, the live-action film adaptation did not keep all of the original functions of the car.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer claims only the live-action film did not keep all functions, implying that other remakes might have retained all. The question asks whether any remake retained all original Mach Five functions. The correct response should state that none of the remakes retained all of them (i.e., 'No, none of the remakes retained all original functions.'). The provided answer is incomplete/incorrect for this reason.

Validation failed for title: Snuff (song)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, to be clear, nobody produced it?', 'question': 'Based on our discussion, are you saying definitively that there is no information available regarding who produced the song?', 'answer': 'No, Dave Fortman and Slipknot produced it.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone. It contains 'Based on our discussion,' which relies on prior turns and cannot be understood without history. The Question should be a self-contained rephrase of the RAG_input, understandable without any prior context and not referencing past dialogue.

Validation failed for title: As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How is this proverb used in modern times?', 'question': "Following the explanation of the proverb 'As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly,' how is this proverb used in modern times?", 'answer': "The proverb is a favourite of the British politician Ken Livingstone who used it on the occasion of his failure to rejoin the Labour Party in 2002. It was also used on occasion in the Parliament of Australia by Paul Keating, in reference to his political opponents. In the TV programme Endeavour (the prequel to Inspector Morse), in the episode titled ``Home,'' Endeavour returns to his family home to visit his sick father. He goes with his sister Joyce to a pub for a drink and the following is part of their conversation : Joyce : ``Why did you go back to Oxford ? '' Endeavour : ``Oh ! A policeman goes where he 's sent . '' Joyce : ``When I told Pop , he just said , ' Proverbs 26 : 11 . ' '' Endeavour : (Recognizing the verse ) ``Well I 've many faults , God knows , but I try to draw the line at masochism . Besides , traditionally it 's the killer that returns to the scene of the crime , not the ... whatever I was . ''", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references 'the explanation' of the proverb and a prior turn, which violates the requirement that the Question be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input. It should be a self-contained restatement such as: 'How is the proverb ‘As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly’ used in modern times?'. Additionally, ensure the Question does not rely on prior history.

Validation failed for title: As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's the significance of the father's use of the proverb in that scene?", 'question': "In the 'Endeavour' episode 'Home', what is the significance of Endeavour's father using the proverb 'As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly'?", 'answer': "In the TV programme Endeavour (the prequel to Inspector Morse), in the episode titled ``Home,'' Endeavour returns to his family home to visit his sick father. He goes with his sister Joyce to a pub for a drink and the following is part of their conversation : Joyce : ``Why did you go back to Oxford ? '' Endeavour : ``Oh ! A policeman goes where he 's sent . '' Joyce : ``When I told Pop , he just said , ' Proverbs 26 : 11 . ' '' Endeavour : (Recognizing the verse ) ``Well I 've many faults , God knows , but I try to draw the line at masochism . Besides , traditionally it 's the killer that returns to the scene of the crime , not the ... whatever I was . ''", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'rag_input' is not sufficiently clear or contextually connected (it says 'that scene' without specifying the episode or context). Additionally, the 'Question' is not identical to the 'rag_input' as required by the first-turn format (it adds explicit context about the 'Endeavour' episode, which is not present in the rag_input). Therefore, the turn does not satisfy the specified constraints.

Validation failed for title: Brigitte Macron
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'When did she and Auzière divorce?', 'question': 'When did Brigitte Trogneux and André-Louis Auzière divorce?', 'answer': 'She divorced Auzière in 2006.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The rag_input asks for the marriage date of Brigitte Trogneux and André-Louis Auzière, but the provided Question asks about their divorce. Consequently, the Answer addressing the divorce is not relevant to the rag_input. Additionally, the Question is not a standalone rephrase of the rag_input since it shifts focus from marriage to divorce, violating the rephrase requirement.

Validation failed for title: Glumdalclitch
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Did she ever leave Gulliver's side?", 'question': "Following her role as Gulliver's nurse and caretaker in Brobdingnag, did Glumdalclitch ever leave Gulliver's side while he was in Brobdingnag?", 'answer': "Yes, Glumdalclitch left Gulliver's side when he moved to the Queen's court.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer is factually incorrect. In Gulliver's Travels, Glumdalclitch accompanies Gulliver to the Queen's court in Brobdingnag; she does not leave his side when he moves to court, so the stated 'Yes' is wrong.

Validation failed for title: All-way stop
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are the disadvantages?', 'question': "According to the MUTCD's guidelines on all-way stops, what are the disadvantages of using them?", 'answer': 'Some of the disadvantages associated with all - way stops are : Increased emissions of hydrocarbons . Increased average delay . Discouraging bicycling . That once installed , stop signs in general are unsafe to remove , accidents that result in injury may increase by 40 % . Once an all - way stop is installed , removal is difficult and risky , as habitual drivers may continue to expect an all - way stop condition .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The input violates Rule 2 by having the Question reference a specific document (MUTCD guidelines); the Question should be self-contained and not refer to a document. Additionally, the Answer includes a contested statistic (a 40% increase in injury accidents) that is not a standard or universally supported claim in MUTCD guidance.

Validation failed for title: All-way stop
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, what does the document say about roundabouts in North America?', 'question': 'Given the discussion about all-way stops and their prevalence compared to roundabouts, what information does the document provide about roundabouts specifically within North America?', 'answer': 'Roundabouts remain rare in North America, where early failures of rotaries and traffic circles caused such designs to lose favor until the gradual introduction of the modern roundabout in the late 20th century.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The input violates Rule 1 and Rule 2. The RAG_input references a 'document' and is not clearly built as a non-standalone continuation, which it must be. The Question is not self-contained: it also references 'the document' and the prior discussion about all-way stops, rather than being a standalone paraphrase of the RAG_input. Both the RAG_input and the Question should avoid document references and be self-contained.

Validation failed for title: Tax incidence
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give an example of a real-world situation where supply might be close to perfectly inelastic?', 'question': 'Based on our discussion of tax incidence and the concept of perfectly inelastic supply, can you provide a real-world example where the supply of a good or service is likely to be close to perfectly inelastic?', 'answer': 'A classic example is land in a specific location. The amount of land is fixed, so the supply is perfectly inelastic. Another example could be tickets to a sold-out event in the very short run. Once all tickets are sold, the supply is fixed.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Question is not standalone; it uses 'Based on our discussion...' which refers to prior turns. It must be a self-contained rephrasing of the rag_input without referencing history.

Validation failed for title: Chinese fire drill
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is the college prank still common?', 'question': 'Considering the various uses of the term "Chinese fire drill," including its application to an American college prank also known as "red-light green-light," is this college prank still commonly practiced today?', 'answer': 'The document does not specify if the college prank is still common.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer relies on the existence of a document and states 'The document does not specify...', which violates the rule that the Answer must be a self-contained, factual response to the standalone Question. It should directly address whether the college prank is still common without referencing documents.

Validation failed for title: Tar Heel
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which of those legends is most likely to be true?', 'question': "Given the various legends surrounding the origin of the 'Tar Heel' nickname, which of these is considered the most plausible explanation?", 'answer': 'The document does not specify which legend is most likely to be true.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide a direct, standalone determination of which Tar Heel legend is most plausible. The Question asks for the most plausible explanation among multiple legends; the Answer instead states that a document doesn’t specify, which is meta-information rather than the ground-truth answer. Therefore the input fails to meet the 'Answer' requirement.

Validation failed for title: Tar Heel
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was that legend widely believed at the time?', 'question': "Considering the legend about General Cornwallis and the Tar River as an origin for the 'Tar Heel' nickname, was this story widely accepted or believed by people during the Revolutionary War era or shortly thereafter?", 'answer': 'The document does not specify whether the legend was widely believed at the time.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide a standalone factual conclusion to the question and instead references a document. It should directly state whether the legend was widely believed (e.g., 'There is little evidence that the Cornwallis tar-river legend was widely believed during the Revolutionary War era; it is one of several legends and not established as a widely held belief.'). Additionally, it should avoid mentioning that a document was provided.

Validation failed for title: Tar Heel
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What did people think the term meant in the 1860s?', 'question': "Given that written records of the 'Tar Heel' nickname began appearing in the 1860s, what was the common understanding or interpretation of the term's meaning during that time period?", 'answer': 'During this time , the nickname Tar Heel was a pejorative, but starting around 1865, the term began to be used as a source of pride.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer asserts that the term Tar Heel began to be used as a source of pride around 1865, which is not aligned with historical consensus. In the 1860s it was generally a pejorative descriptor, and pride or non-derogatory usage emerged later. Thus the Answer is not factually correct relative to the RAG_input/Question.

Validation failed for title: First day of school
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is there a similar tradition in Poland?', 'question': 'Considering the tradition of bringing flowers to teachers on the first day of school in Russia, is there a similar tradition observed in Poland?', 'answer': 'I am sorry, I do not have information about traditions in Poland related to the first day of school.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide a factual, standalone response to the comparative Question. It simply states a lack of information rather than giving a concise, verifiable answer about whether Poland has a similar first-day tradition (and, if applicable, describing the nature or absence of such a tradition). The rest of the input (RAG_input, Question, Type) is acceptable, but the Answer fails to meet the factual relevance requirement.

Validation failed for title: Mining industry of Nigeria
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What specific corporations were privatized around that time?', 'question': 'Following the Federal Minerals and Mining Act of 1999, and the effort to reduce the state monopoly in the mining industry, what specific mining corporations were privatized by the Obasanjo administration?', 'answer': 'The Nigerian Coal Corporation (NCC)', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The question asks for multiple mining corporations privatized by the Obasanjo administration. The answer lists only the Nigerian Coal Corporation (NCC), which is incomplete. Additionally, the source indicates privatization efforts were ongoing and does not confirm NCC (or others) were fully privatized by 1999, making the single-item answer insufficient and potentially inaccurate.

Validation failed for title: Morpheme
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there examples where the length of a word might mislead you about the number of morphemes it contains?', 'question': "Following our discussion about words that appear to have multiple morphemes but don't (like 'relate' and 'Madagascar'), can you provide examples from the document where the sheer length of a word might be misleading about its morphemic composition?", 'answer': 'Yes, the document states that the length of the words does not determine if it has multiple morphemes or not. For example, Madagascar is long and it might seem to have morphemes like mad, gas, and car, but it does not. Conversely, small words can have multiple morphemes (e.g. dogs).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone: it refers to 'our discussion' and to 'the document,' and it asks for examples 'from the document.' It must be a self-contained rephrasing of the rag_input without any history or document references.

Validation failed for title: Morpheme
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's the difference between derivational and inflectional morphemes again?", 'question': 'You mentioned derivational and inflectional morphemes as part of the process. Could you clarify the key distinctions between these two types of morphemes?', 'answer': "Derivational morphemes change the meaning or part of speech of a word (e.g., happy to happiness). Inflectional morphemes modify grammatical aspects like tense, number, or case without changing the word's core meaning or part of speech (e.g., dog to dogs, wait to waited).", 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone: it refers to 'the process' and to prior turns, relying on conversation history. A valid Question should be a self-contained rephrase of the RAG_input without referencing prior dialogue or documents.

Validation failed for title: Morpheme
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are allomorphs?', 'question': 'Can you define and give examples of allomorphs?', 'answer': "Allomorphs are variants of a morpheme that differ in pronunciation but are semantically identical. For example, in English, the plural marker -(e)s of regular nouns can be pronounced /-z/, /-s/, or /-ɪz, -əz/, depending on the final sound of the noun's singular form. Examples: plural ending s (as in bats), z (as in bugs), iz (as in buses).", 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: RAG_input is not clearly built on the prior turn and lacks context; it is too generic to be contextually connected (fails requirement: RAG_input must be clear, specific, and build on the prior turn).

Validation failed for title: Elizabethan government
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What kind of laws did Parliament pass during her reign?', 'question': "Considering that Parliament passed 438 laws during Queen Elizabeth I's reign, what were the general types or subject matters of these laws?", 'answer': "The laws passed by Parliament under Elizabeth's reign were either public, applying to all, or private, applying only to certain people.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a faithful standalone rephrase of the RAG_input because it introduces new information (the specific figure '438 laws'), which is not present in the rag_input. A standalone rephrase should restate the same inquiry without adding new facts.

Validation failed for title: Free agent
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give me a specific example of how the qualifying offer affects the draft pick compensation for an RFA?', 'question': 'In the National Football League, regarding Restricted Free Agents (RFAs), can you provide a specific example illustrating how the level of the qualifying offer made by the original team impacts the draft pick compensation they receive if they choose not to match an offer from another team and the RFA signs elsewhere?', 'answer': 'The document does not provide a specific example.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide a concrete example in response to the Question; it merely states that a document does not contain an example. This fails the requirement that the Answer be a correct, standalone answer to the question. It also implicitly references a document, which violates the RAG_input rule to avoid mentioning documents.

Validation failed for title: Free agent
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'When did the NHL change to this no-compensation system?', 'question': 'Considering that the National Hockey League (NHL) used to offer compensation for teams losing unrestricted free agents but currently does not, in what year did the NHL switch to the current system where no compensation is provided?', 'answer': 'The document does not explicitly state when the NHL changed to the no-compensation system, but it does say the change occurred with the current CBA.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide the requested year for when the NHL switched to the no-compensation system. Additionally, it inappropriately refers to a document ('The document does not explicitly state...'), which violates the rule to avoid mentioning that a document was provided.

Validation failed for title: Cedar River (Iowa River tributary)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was the 2008 flood worse than the 1993 flood?', 'question': 'Considering the Cedar River flooded in both 1993 and 2008, was the flooding in 2008 worse than the flood in 1993?', 'answer': "The river crested at 19.83 feet in 1993. This was the worst flood in Iowa's recorded history, before the Cedar River flooded again in 2008.", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The question asks whether the 2008 Cedar River flood was worse than the 1993 flood. The provided answer states that 1993 was the worst flood before 2008, implying 2008 was not worse. In reality, the 2008 flood was more severe in Cedar Rapids and overall, so the answer does not accurately address the comparative question.

Validation failed for title: Age of marriage in the United States
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which states have no statutory minimum age?', 'question': 'Following the discussion about the general age of marriage in the United States and its variations, which states do not have a statutory minimum age for marriage if other legal conditions are met?', 'answer': 'Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule 2 violated: the Question is not a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input. It relies on prior discussion context ('Following the discussion about...') and adds conditional phrasing, which makes it not stand alone as a rephrased question. It should be a standalone, self-contained rephrase of 'Which states have no statutory minimum age?'. Additionally, ensure the Answer is factually accurate and directly relevant to the standalone Question; the current framing raises concerns about consistency with the required standalone format.

Validation failed for title: Age of marriage in the United States
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Has any state completely banned marriage for minors?', 'question': 'Given the discussion about minimum marriage ages and common law exceptions, have any states in the U.S. enacted laws that completely prohibit marriage for individuals under the age of 18, regardless of parental consent or other legal conditions?', 'answer': 'Yes, Delaware and New Jersey have implemented a clear minimum age of 18 with no exceptions.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrase of the rag_input. It references a prior discussion ('Given the discussion about minimum marriage ages and common law exceptions'), which makes it dependent on history rather than self-contained. The rag_input itself is simple, and the Question should be a self-contained rephrase without referencing earlier turns. The 'rag_input', 'Type', and 'Answer' are otherwise aligned.

Validation failed for title: Out of left field
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, before Shaw, it was strictly baseball lingo, then?', 'question': 'Based on the information about Arnold Shaw and the phrase "out of left field", was the phrase exclusively used in baseball terminology before Shaw documented its use in the music industry?', 'answer': "According to the document, Shaw documented the phrase's use in the music industry in 1949. The document also mentions the phrase's origin in baseball terminology, specifically related to the left fielder's position. However, it doesn't explicitly state that the phrase was *exclusively* baseball lingo before Shaw's documentation, but it does strongly imply it.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule 2 violation: The 'Question' is not fully standalone. It relies on prior conversation context by saying 'Based on the information about Arnold Shaw' and references Shaw having documented usage in the music industry. A valid standalone question should be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input, understandable without any history (and should not depend on external documentation context). Additionally, the standalone phrasing should not introduce new contextual assumptions beyond the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Out of left field
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Were there any competing explanations for the phrase's origin at the time, or was Shaw's pretty much accepted?", 'question': 'In 1949, when Arnold Shaw documented the use of "out of left field" in the music industry, were there any other explanations for the phrase\'s origin besides its connection to baseball, or was Shaw\'s explanation generally accepted at the time?', 'answer': "The document does not provide information about competing explanations for the phrase's origin at the time of Shaw's writing in 1949, nor does it indicate whether Shaw's explanation was immediately accepted.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document,' which violates the constraint to avoid mentioning that a document was provided; the response should be self-contained and not rely on or refer to source documents.

Validation failed for title: Out of left field
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So the mental institution theory came about later, then?', 'question': 'Considering the various explanations for the phrase "out of left field", including Arnold Shaw\'s documentation of its use in the music industry and the connection to baseball, did the theory about the mental institution near the Chicago Cubs\' West Side Grounds arise later than these other explanations?', 'answer': "The document suggests that the mental institution theory is a 'popular but debated explanation' and also states that the origin of the phrase is unclear and disputed. While the document highlights Shaw's work as 'one of the earliest to record the idiomatic use of the phrase' it does not provide specific timelines to confirm whether the mental institution theory emerged later or earlier relative to Shaw's documentation or baseball origins.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone: it references Arnold Shaw's documentation and the West Side Grounds context, which rely on prior conversation/documentation. The format requires a fully self-contained question that does not depend on external sources. Additionally, the Answer refers to 'the document,' which violates the requirement to answer based solely on the standalone RAG_input/Question without citing sources.

Validation failed for title: Sun path
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What happens at the poles during those solstices?', 'question': "Given the descriptions of the sun's position at 70° latitude during the summer and winter solstices, how does the sun's behavior differ at the North and South Poles during those same solstices?", 'answer': 'At the time of the summer or winter solstices, the Sun is 23.44 ° degrees above or below the horizon respectively, irrespective of time of day . Whilst the Sun is up ( during summer months ) it will circle around the whole sky ( clockwise from the North Pole and counter-clockwise from the South Pole ) , appearing to stay at the same angle from the horizon , therefore the concept of day or night is meaningless.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Question is not a faithful standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. The RAG_input asks specifically about the winter solstice at 70° latitude, whereas the Question expands the scope to compare both summer and winter solstices and references the poles, altering the original focus rather than restating it in a self-contained way.

Validation failed for title: Sun path
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "And what's the significance of 23.44°?", 'question': "Given the discussion about the sun's path at 70° latitude and at the poles, with mention of the sun reaching approximately 23.44° elevation, what is the significance of the 23.44° value in relation to the sun's movement and the Earth?", 'answer': "The Earth 's axis of rotation tilts about 23.5 degrees , relative to the plane of Earth 's orbit around the Sun . As the Earth orbits the Sun , this creates the 47 ° declination difference between the solstice sun paths , as well as the hemisphere - specific difference between summer and winter .", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a faithful standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. The RAG_input asks specifically about the significance of 23.44°, whereas the Question expands to pole-related contexts and solstice comparisons, altering the scope. This fails the requirement that the Question be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input (self-contained and not introducing broader or different angles).

Validation failed for title: You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's the poem about?", 'question': 'Given that Gabriel Okara\'s most famous poem is "You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed," what is the poem about?', 'answer': "The poem is about the interplay of different interpretations of the same sounds, sights, and dances, commonly thought to be between a white colonialist and an African native. It addresses the derision of African beliefs by the colonizer and the eventual realization of the colonizer's ignorance by the African.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The RAG_input is too vague and not clearly linked to a prior turn; it lacks specificity about which poem is being referenced. The Question should be a standalone but faithful rephrase of the RAG_input, yet it adds external context ('Gabriel Okara's most famous poem') that isn’t present in the RAG_input, making it not a direct self-contained restatement.

Validation failed for title: You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Why is that?', 'question': 'Given that Gabriel Okara\'s poem "You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed" is sometimes wrongly attributed to Dennis Brutus, why is it misattributed?', 'answer': 'The document does not provide a reason why the poem is misattributed.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references a document ("The document does not provide..."), which violates the rule to never mention that a document was provided. Additionally, the Question adds extraneous context (Dennis Brutus) not present in the RAG_input, failing the requirement that the Question be a standalone restatement of the RAG_input.
