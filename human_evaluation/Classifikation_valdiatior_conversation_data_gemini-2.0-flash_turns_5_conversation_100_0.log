Validation failed for title: Making out
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, was "making out" always about sex?', 'question': 'Given that "making out" originally meant "to succeed," and later evolved to mean "to seduce" or "to have sexual intercourse with," was the term exclusively associated with sexual activity throughout its history?', 'answer': "Originally , it meant `` to seduce '' or `` to have sexual intercourse with '' . Studies indicate that at the beginning of the 20th century , premarital sex increased , and with it , petting behavior in the 1920s .", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer misstates the origin: historical sources indicate the sexual sense of 'make out' developed in the 1930s–1940s from the meaning 'to succeed,' not the other way around. Therefore, the answer is factually incorrect and does not accurately reflect whether the term was exclusively sexual throughout its history.

Validation failed for title: Making out
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, when did "petting" become associated with "making out?"', 'question': 'Given that "making out" originally meant "to succeed" and later gained sexual connotations, at what point did "petting" become associated with the term "making out?"', 'answer': 'Studies indicate that at the beginning of the 20th century , premarital sex increased , and with it , petting behavior in the 1920s .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided Answer asserts that petting became associated with 'making out' in the 1920s. Historical sources indicate that the sexual connotations of 'making out' developed in the 1930s–1940s (from the meaning 'to succeed'), with heavy petting as part of making out emerging during that period. The 1920s association does not accurately establish when the term started to include 'petting' as part of 'making out.'

Validation failed for title: Making out
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were "make-out rooms" common everywhere in the US?', 'question': 'Given that "make-out parties" with designated "make-out rooms" existed in the United States, were these "make-out rooms" a widespread phenomenon across all regions of the U.S., or were they more localized to specific areas or communities?', 'answer': 'Teenagers sometimes play party games in which making out is the main activity as an act of exploration . Games in this category include seven minutes in heaven and spin the bottle .', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The provided Answer does not address whether 'make-out rooms' were widespread across the US. It merely describes general 'make-out' activities (e.g., party games) and does not provide information about regional prevalence or distribution, which is what the clarifying Question asks.

Validation failed for title: Subsistence agriculture
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What staples were typically purchased?', 'question': 'Following the decline of subsistence agriculture in Europe and North America, and the rise of family farms that grew much of their own food but still purchased some goods, what staples did these farms typically buy?', 'answer': 'Typically including sugar ; coffee and tea ; petroleum distillates ( petrol , kerosene , fuel oil ) ; textile products such as bolts of cloth , needles , and thread ; medicines ; hardware products such as nails , screws , and wire ; and a few discretionary items such as candy or books.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is not sufficiently clear or contextually connected to the prior turn. On its own, it is too vague and does not clearly build on the preceding discussion; the standalone Question includes the necessary context, but the rag_input by itself fails to meet requirement 1.

Class: RAG_InputNotConnected

Validation failed for title: Subsistence agriculture
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What sort of items were commonly bartered?', 'question': 'Considering that family farms in North America and Europe, even as recently as the 1950s, often acquired items through barter, what sort of items were commonly offered in these bartering arrangements?', 'answer': 'The document mentions that services from physicians, veterinarians, blacksmiths, and others, were often bought with barter rather than currency. It does not specify what items were bartered for these services.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided answer claims that no specific barter items were listed, but the referenced material notes several specific barter items (e.g., sugar; coffee and tea; petroleum distillates; textiles such as cloth, needles, and thread; medicines; hardware; candy or books) and indicates that services from professionals (physicians, veterinarians, blacksmiths, etc.) were often obtained through barter as well.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Subsistence agriculture
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did they only barter agricultural produce for those staples, or were other goods used as well?', 'question': 'Given that family farms in North America and Europe sometimes bartered for goods and services, and considering agricultural produce was one common barter item, did these farms *only* barter agricultural produce for staples like sugar, coffee, and textiles, or did they also use other types of goods in these bartering arrangements?', 'answer': 'The document does not specify other types of goods used in bartering arrangements beyond agricultural produce in exchange for staples and services.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The provided Answer is factually incorrect: the referenced context indicates that, in addition to agricultural produce, a variety of other goods were bartered (e.g., sugar, coffee and tea, petroleum distillates, textiles like bolts of cloth, needles, and thread, medicines, hardware, and discretionary items like candy or books), and services from professionals were also exchanged via barter. Therefore, it was not limited to agricultural produce alone.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Fire triangle
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, it's not a triangle anymore, right?", 'question': 'Given that you cannot answer what happens when you add a chemical chain reaction to the fire triangle, does that mean the shape is no longer a triangle?', 'answer': 'The fire tetrahedron represents the addition of a component in the chemical chain reaction , to the three already present in the fire triangle.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. It adds meta-context about an inability to answer and introduces framing (chemical chain reaction) that is not a direct restatement of 'So, it's not a triangle anymore, right?'. A correct standalone rephrase should restate the RAG_input in a self-contained way, e.g., 'If the fire triangle is extended to include the chemical chain reaction, is it still a triangle?'

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Fire triangle
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you use water on all fires?', 'question': 'Given that there are four essential components needed for a fire to occur and continue, can water be used to extinguish all fires?', 'answer': 'Water can not be used on certain type of fires : Fires where live electricity is present -- as water conducts electricity it presents an electrocution hazard. Hydrocarbon fires -- as it will only spread the fire because of the difference in density / hydrophobicity. For example , adding water to a fire with an oil source will cause the oil to spread , since oil and water do not mix. Metal fires -- as these fires produce huge amounts of energy ( up to 7.550 calories / kg for aluminium ) and water can also create violent chemical reactions with burning metal ( possibly even serving as an additional oxidizing agent ).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Requirement 2 was violated: The 'Question' is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. It introduces an extraneous 'four essential components' concept and does not clearly restate the original question in a self-contained way. A valid standalone question would restate 'Can you use water on all fires?' without adding new context or assumptions.

Validation failed for title: Russian Blue
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are they considered hypoallergenic?', 'question': 'Given that Russian Blue cats tend to have few health problems and generally have little to no genetic issues, are they considered to be hypoallergenic?', 'answer': 'They are also considered to be hypoallergenic.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer states that Russian Blue cats are hypoallergenic in an absolute sense. There is no breed that is universally hypoallergenic; at best, some sources suggest they may produce less Fel d 1 or cause milder reactions for some individuals, but allergic responses vary and many people with cat allergies still react. Therefore the Answer is not factually correct or adequately nuanced.

Validation failed for title: The Reverend Mr. Black
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was the B-side successful?', 'question': 'Given that The Kingston Trio released "The Reverend Mr. Black" as a single in 1963, along with a B-side called "One More Round", was the B-side, "One More Round", successful?', 'answer': 'The document does not mention if "One More Round" was successful.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references a 'document' as its basis, which violates the requirement that the response be standalone and not rely on external documents. The Answer should directly address whether the B-side was successful without citing a document.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: The Reverend Mr. Black
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did Wheeler, Leiber, and Stoller record it themselves?', 'question': 'Given that Billy Edd Wheeler, Jerry Leiber, and Mike Stoller wrote "The Reverend Mr. Black," did they also record their own version of the song?', 'answer': 'The provided text does not state whether Wheeler, Leiber, and Stoller recorded their own version.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the provided text' (i.e., a document), which violates the rule that the response must not mention that a document was provided. The Answer should be self-contained and address whether Wheeler, Leiber, and Stoller recorded their own version without citing sources.

Class: documentMentioned

Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What was Cash's version like?", 'question': 'Given that Johnny Cash covered "The Reverend Mr. Black" in 1981, what are the characteristics or details of his version?', 'answer': 'The document mentions Johnny Cash covered the song in 1981 for his album The Baron, but it provides no details about the characteristics of his version.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer mentions 'The document mentions...' which violates the requirement that the answer be self-contained and not refer to any document/sources. The answer should describe Cash's version without citing or referencing a document.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: Interphase
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can a cell re-enter the cycle from G0, and if so, what triggers that?', 'question': 'If a cell enters the G0 phase after G1, is it possible for it to re-enter the cell cycle, and if so, what conditions or signals would trigger it to do so?', 'answer': 'After the successful completion of mitosis and cytokinesis , both resulting daughter cells re-enter G1 of interphase. In alternative fashion, interphase is sometimes interrupted by G0 phase , which , in some circumstances , may then end and be followed by the remaining stages of interphase .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not adequately address the specific RAG_input question about re-entry from G0 and the triggers for re-entering the cell cycle. It mainly notes re-entry after mitosis and that G0 can end but does not specify the actual signals or conditions (e.g., mitogenic growth factors, nutrient cues, cell-density signals) that would trigger a cell in G0 to re-enter the cycle. The response is therefore incomplete and not fully aligned with the standalone Question.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Interphase
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How do INK4a/ARF proteins inhibit the cell cycle?', 'question': 'The G1 checkpoint is regulated by proteins like INK4a/ARF. How specifically do these INK4a/ARF proteins inhibit the progression of the cell cycle?', 'answer': 'The document mentions CDK inhibitor INK4a / ARF ( p14arf / p16 , p15 , p18 , p19 ) cip / kip ( p21 , p27 , p57 ).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not actually explain how INK4a/ARF proteins inhibit the cell cycle. It merely lists some related proteins (CDK inhibitors) without describing the mechanism (e.g., INK4a inhibits CDK4/6 to prevent Rb phosphorylation; ARF stabilizes p53 to induce p21 and cell cycle arrest). The content is incomplete and does not provide a correct, self-contained explanation for the Question.

Validation failed for title: Fynbos
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What makes the silver peas so special?', 'question': 'You mentioned silver peas returning to Table Mountain after invasive species removal in the fynbos region. What makes the silver peas so special or important in this ecosystem?', 'answer': 'There is no specific reason silver peas are special mentioned in the document. The document only mentions them anecdotally as a sign of successful conservation efforts.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer incorrectly asserts there is no special significance for the silver peas. The provided context notes anecdotal evidence that endemic silver peas have returned to Table Mountain after invasive species removal, suggesting their return is an indicator of conservation success and potential ecological importance. The answer is not factually aligned with the given content.

Class: Groundtruth

Validation failed for title: Fynbos
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are the biggest challenges in monitoring the fynbos?', 'question': 'Given that systematic monitoring of species recovery and ecosystem health in the fynbos region is lacking, what are the biggest challenges or obstacles preventing effective monitoring of the fynbos?', 'answer': "The document doesn't explicitly state the challenges of monitoring. However, it implies that the remoteness of some areas and the sheer diversity of the flora make monitoring difficult.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references a document (“The document doesn't explicitly state...”), which violates the rule that the RAG_input/Question/Answer should not mention that a document was provided. While the content about remoteness and biodiversity being challenges could be plausible, the explicit document reference makes the response non-compliant.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: Mass number
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about alpha decay?', 'question': 'Given what happens to the mass number during beta decay, what happens to the mass number during alpha decay?', 'answer': 'During alpha decay, the nucleus loses two neutrons and two protons in the form of an alpha particle. Thus the atomic number and the number of neutrons each decrease by 2, so that the mass number decreases by 4.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references beta decay and presupposes prior conversation. It should be a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input ('What about alpha decay?') without referring to beta decay or prior turns. The Answer itself is factually correct for alpha decay, but the Question fails the standalone requirement.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Context effect
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give me an example of how context effects are used in marketing?', 'question': 'Following our discussion about context effects, can you provide an example of how they are specifically used in marketing strategies?', 'answer': "Context effects can influence consumers' choice behavior. The three main context effects researched in marketing are the compromise effect, the attractiveness effect, and the similarity effect. For example, the compromise effect states that objects that are priced in the middle of choice sets are looked on more favorably.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone. It begins with 'Following our discussion...' which references a prior turn, so it does not rephrase the RAG_input in a self-contained manner. The Question should be a standalone restatement of the rag_input without referencing prior discussion or history.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Context effect
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How can the similarity effect be used to increase sales of a particular product?', 'question': 'Given the explanation of the similarity effect, what are some specific strategies a company could use to leverage this effect and increase sales of a particular product?', 'answer': 'Firms looking to increase product resale can use these context effects to construct more profitable marketing strategies . The idea of these context effects in the marketing industry is to allow for more profitable items a boost in optional sharing ; a productivity boost based on contextual effects for and against certain items.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not fully standalone: it references 'the explanation' of the similarity effect and assumes prior discussion, rather than restating the rag_input in self-contained form. Additionally, the Answer is vague and not actionable; it does not provide concrete strategies for leveraging the similarity effect to increase sales and contains ambiguous phrasing.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Context effect
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Could you provide a real-world example of a company successfully using the similarity effect to boost sales?', 'question': 'Describe a specific, real-world example of a company that strategically applied the similarity effect in its marketing practices to achieve a measurable increase in sales for a particular product.', 'answer': 'N/A', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Answer' field is 'N/A' and does not provide a factual answer to the standalone 'Question'. This fails Rule 4 (Answer must be factually correct and relevant to the RAG_input / standalone Question). The other fields (rag_input, Question, Type) are acceptable in isolation, but the missing valid answer invalidates the input.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Beam bridge
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does this compare to truss bridges?', 'question': 'Given that beam bridges rarely span more than 250 feet, how does the maximum span of beam bridges compare to the maximum span of truss bridges?', 'answer': "The farther apart its supports , the weaker a beam bridge gets . As a result , beam bridges rarely span more than 250 feet ( 80 m ) . This does n't mean beam bridges are n't used to cross great distances , it only means that a series of beam bridges must be joined together , creating what 's known as a continuous span .", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the Comparative Question about comparing beam bridge spans to truss bridge spans. It only reiterates that beam bridges rarely exceed ~250 ft and does not include any information or explicit comparison with truss bridges, failing the Comparative type requirement.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Beam bridge
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there innovative designs to accommodate thrust in beam bridges, similar to how trusses handle it?', 'question': 'Given that beam bridges typically cannot accommodate thrust, are there any innovative beam bridge designs that address this limitation to handle thrust forces, similar to how truss bridges do with their interconnected elements?', 'answer': 'Because no moments are transferred , thrust , as from an arch bridge , can not be accommodated , so leading to innovative designs , such as lenticular trusses & bow string arches , which contain the horizontal forces within the superstructure .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the Question correctly. It states that thrust cannot be accommodated by beam bridges (an absolute claim) and then cites lenticular trusses and bowstring arches, which are not beam-bridge designs. A proper response would discuss beam-bridge approaches to manage thrust (e.g., braced/girder configurations, braced spans, or designs that introduce internal stiffness or arch-like action within a beam-bridge) rather than non-beam arch/truss solutions.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Beam bridge
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, beam bridges cannot be used where significant horizontal forces are present?', 'question': 'Given that beam bridges cannot accommodate horizontal forces within their structure, does that mean that beam bridges are unsuitable for locations or applications where significant horizontal forces are present?', 'answer': 'The only supports are provided by piers.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the Question about suitability for locations with significant horizontal forces. It merely states that 'the only supports are provided by piers' without explaining whether beam bridges can or cannot handle horizontal thrust. A correct response should state that beam bridges are generally not designed to accommodate significant horizontal forces, thereby making them unsuitable for such locations, or provide a well-supported nuance.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Cold feet
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Besides marriage, are there other common situations where people get cold feet?', 'question': 'Considering the earlier discussion about "cold feet" as a psychological phenomenon and its specific research regarding marriage, are there other common situations or contexts, outside of marriage, where people are known to experience "cold feet"?', 'answer': "A common use of the phrase is when people fear the commitment of marriage and get `` cold feet '' before a wedding ceremony . This pre-marital doubt or fear may manifest for a variety of reasons and sometimes cause the bride or groom to back out of a planned marriage.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Question is not standalone: it references 'the earlier discussion' and marital context, making it rely on prior turns instead of being self-contained. It should restate the prompt in a self-contained way. Additionally, the Answer only discusses marriage and does not address non-marital contexts as asked by the rag_input, thus failing to be relevant to the provided RAG_input/Question.

Validation failed for title: Prime Minister of France
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Was Philippe's appointment typical?", 'question': "Was Édouard Philippe's appointment as Prime Minister typical, compared to other Prime Ministers of France?", 'answer': 'It depends on what aspect is being considered. In some ways yes, in other ways no. He was chosen from the National Assembly, which is typical. However, the document mentions instances where the President selected a non-officeholder.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document', which violates the requirement to never mention a document or its provision. The answer should be self-contained and based solely on the RAG_input/Question without referencing sources.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: Prime Minister of France
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Has a woman ever held the position?', 'question': 'Given the discussion about Édouard Philippe and previous Prime Ministers, has a woman ever held the position of Prime Minister of France?', 'answer': 'Yes, Édith Cresson was Prime Minister from 1991 to 1992.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is too vague and not clearly connected to the prior turn (it lacks an explicit referent). The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input and instead references prior discussion about Édouard Philippe, making it non-self-contained per the rules.

Class: RAG_InputNotConnected

Validation failed for title: Blood Sweat & Tears (song)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there different editions?', 'question': 'Following the release of the Japanese version of Blood Sweat & Tears on May 10, 2017, were there different editions of the single?', 'answer': "Yes, there were four editions made available: a standard edition, and three limited editions, Type A, Type B, and Type C, which excluded ``Spring Day ''.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to 'rag_input' instead of a standalone rephrasing (rule 2). Additionally, the payload is missing the required 'Type' field (rule 3).

Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who directed the music video?', 'question': 'Who directed the music video for the song "My Name Is Human"?', 'answer': "The provided document doesn't mention the director of the music video.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not directly answer the Question. The standalone Question asks for the director's name of the music video for 'My Name Is Human'; the provided Answer merely states that the document doesn't mention the director, which is not a direct factual answer. A correct Answer should provide the director’s name (if known) or clearly indicate that the information is not available. Additionally, referencing a 'document' is a meta statement rather than a substantive answer to the question.

Validation failed for title: Happy Days (TV theme)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did Pratt & McClain ever perform it on the show itself?', 'question': 'Besides releasing it as a single, did Pratt & McClain ever perform the Happy Days theme song on the Happy Days TV show itself?', 'answer': 'Unknown.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer field is not a factual, stand-alone response to the Question. It must provide a definitive answer (e.g., 'No; Pratt & McClain did not perform the theme on the show itself' with any necessary context). Using 'Unknown.' does not meet the requirement for a factually correct answer.

Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'When did construction begin for that?', 'question': 'When did construction begin for Toy Story Land, which replaced the Studio Backlot Tour?', 'answer': 'mid-2016', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input; it should be a standalone rephrasing that is understandable without referencing prior turns, not a verbatim copy.

Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'I meant the music video.', 'question': 'You stated that the song "Be Careful" by Cardi B was released on March 29, 2018. I meant, when was the music video released?', 'answer': 'May 21, 2018', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it relies on prior conversation by referencing that the song was released on March 29, 2018. A valid Question should be a self-contained restatement of the RAG_input (e.g., 'When was the Be Careful music video released?').

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Be Careful (Cardi B song)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was she pregnant in the video?', 'question': 'In the music video for "Be Careful" by Cardi B, was she pregnant?', 'answer': 'The provided document does not mention whether Cardi B was pregnant in the music video.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer is not factually correct; Cardi B is not depicted as pregnant in the 'Be Careful' music video, so the correct answer should state that. Additionally, the Answer references 'the provided document,' which violates the rule to avoid mentioning documents and should be a self-contained response.

Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's the purpose of residencies and fellowships?", 'question': 'Given that residencies and fellowships are optional after completing a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program, what is their purpose?', 'answer': 'These programs provide experienced clinicians with advanced knowledge, clinical skills, and professional behavior, usually in a specific specialty practice area. They typically culminate in work that contributes new knowledge to clinical practice in the profession.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Requirement failure: The 'Question' must be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input (self-contained and not identical to the Rag_input). In this case, 'Question' is identical to 'rag_input', which violates the rephrasing requirement. The other fields are valid: rag_input is clear and contextually connected, and the Answer is factually correct.

Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's ABPTS?", 'question': 'The previous answer mentioned ABPTS clinical specialization. What is ABPTS?', 'answer': 'The document does not define ABPTS. Therefore, I cannot answer this question.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer is not factually correct and violates the 'no document' rule. ABPTS stands for American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties, the body that credentials board-certified specialties for physical therapists. The Answer should provide this definition rather than claim no definition or reference a document.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Andre Gunder Frank
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Didn't he work at the University of Chile?", 'question': 'Did Andre Gunder Frank work at the University of Chile?', 'answer': 'Yes, Frank worked as a Professor of Sociology and Economics at the University of Chile and was involved in reforms under the government of Salvador Allende.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The declared Type 'Correction' is inappropriate here because the previous answer was accurate; this should be a Follow-up or Clarification, not a correction. All other fields are acceptable.

Class: Type

Validation failed for title: Andre Gunder Frank
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Okay, but what was Allende's role then?", 'question': "If Andre Gunder Frank didn't work at the University of Chile, what was Salvador Allende's role in relation to Frank's time in Latin America?", 'answer': 'Frank was involved in reforms under the government of Salvador Allende while at the University of Chile.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a faithful standalone rephrase of the RAG_input: it introduces an unsupported hypothetical ('If Andre Gunder Frank didn't work at the University of Chile') and shifts the focus away from Allende's actual role. The Answer describes Frank's involvement rather than Salvador Allende's role, so it does not correctly answer the standalone question.

Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What band did he later join?', 'question': 'Following his work with Elvin Bishop on "Fooled Around and Fell in Love", what band did Mickey Thomas later join?', 'answer': 'Jefferson Starship', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to the 'rag_input' instead of a standalone rephrasing that provides sufficient context ( violates Rule 2). Additionally, the required 'Type' field is missing; without a Type, it cannot be evaluated against the allowed categories (Follow-up, Clarification, Correction, Comparative). The 'Answer' is factually correct, but the overall entry fails due to these violations.

Validation failed for title: Hung jury
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So in civil cases, if only 9 jurors are present after three hours, what happens?', 'question': 'Given that in Scotland civil cases require a jury of 12, but at least 10 jurors are needed to continue the trial, what happens if only 9 jurors are present after three hours of deliberation?', 'answer': "It is possible to have a hung jury if there is a tied vote after three hours ' deliberation.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided Answer describes a hung jury from a tied vote after three hours, but the scenario specifies 9 jurors in a Scottish civil trial. Scottish civil trials require 12 jurors with a minimum of 10 to continue; with only 9 jurors remaining, the trial cannot continue. The correct outcome is not a hung jury under these rules, so the Answer is incorrect/incomplete.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Hung jury
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, is that considered a hung jury then, or something else?', 'question': 'Given that a Scottish civil trial requires a minimum of 10 jurors to continue, and if only 9 jurors are present, the trial cannot continue, is this situation considered a hung jury, or does it have a different designation?', 'answer': "It is possible to have a hung jury if there is a tied vote after three hours ' deliberation.", 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer incorrectly designates the scenario as a hung jury. In Scotland, a civil trial requires 12 jurors with a minimum of 10 to continue; with only 9 jurors present, the trial cannot proceed. A hung jury implies a deadlock with the required number of jurors seated (not 9). The correct designation would be that the trial cannot continue and would require retrial or a new panel; the Answer misstates the condition and outcome for the given 9-juror scenario.

Reason: The Answer does not provide a direct factual response to the standalone Question. The question asks whether the ritual of throwing a straw horse is still practiced today. A correct answer should state whether there is evidence of current practice (e.g., 'There is no evidence it is still practiced today' or 'Not widely practiced today'), rather than saying it is 'Unanswerable from the document.' The response is a meta-statement about the document rather than a substantive answer to the question. Additionally, the Answer should be self-contained and not reference external documents.

Validation failed for title: Horse latitudes
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any modern cultural references to the horse latitudes?', 'question': "Given the discussion about the origin and meaning of 'horse latitudes', are there any modern cultural references to them?", 'answer': "`` Horse Latitudes , '' The Doors song , a spoken - word piece written by Jim Morrison , from their second album , Strange Days , ( 1967 ) , evokes the second explanation above . Morrison wrote the prose piece when he was 12 years old.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The rag_input asks for modern cultural references to horse latitudes. The provided answer cites a 1967 Doors song and does not address contemporary or recent references, making it not factually correct or relevant to the standalone question.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Myelin
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What role does cholesterol play?', 'question': 'Considering the composition of myelin, including lipids and proteins, what specific function or role does cholesterol have within the myelin sheath?', 'answer': 'Cholesterol is an essential component of myelin, which comprises about 40 % water ; the dry mass comprises between 60 % and 75 % lipids and between 15 % and 25 % proteins .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the specific function of cholesterol in the myelin sheath. It only states cholesterol is an essential component and repeats general composition data, but fails to explain how cholesterol contributes to myelin structure or function (e.g., membrane stability, fluidity, and insulation).

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Minié ball
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did that cavity reduce manufacturing costs?', 'question': "Following the discussion about Burton's improved Minié ball design and its deep cavity at the base, how exactly did the addition of that cavity lead to reduced manufacturing costs for the bullet?", 'answer': 'The document does not specify how the cavity reduced manufacturing costs, only that it did.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer claims no source specifies how the cavity reduced costs, but prior content indicates Burton's deeper base cavity produced a cheaper bullet, implying a cost reduction due to the design. Therefore the Answer is not factually correct. It also relies on referencing a document, which conflicts with the RAG_input constraint that such references should be avoided.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Minié ball
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, it was less about simplifying construction and more about using less material?', 'question': "Given the discussion of Burton's Minié ball design and its cheaper production costs, was the primary factor in reducing costs the simplification of the construction process, or was it the reduced amount of materials needed to manufacture the bullet with the deep cavity?", 'answer': 'The deep cavity likely reduced the amount of lead needed for each bullet, thus reducing the cost of materials.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Answer asserts a specific mechanism (reduced lead usage) for cost savings that is not explicitly supported by the provided material; the source only notes that Burton's design produced a cheaper bullet, without detailing how the costs were reduced. This makes the Answer speculative and not factually grounded.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: London Bridge (Lake Havasu City)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How much did it cost to move?', 'question': 'Considering that Robert P. McCulloch bought the London Bridge and moved it to Lake Havasu City, Arizona to attract tourists, how much did it cost him to move the bridge?', 'answer': "The document doesn't state the exact cost of moving the bridge, but it does say McCulloch recouped all his expenses on the purchase and shipping of the bridge through improved land sales.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input fails Rule 1: it is not clear or contextually connected to the prior turn. 'How much did it cost to move?' is ambiguous without specifying what was moved, by whom, and why. The standalone requirement for RAG_input asks for clear context-building on the prior turn.

Class: RAG_InputNotConnected

Validation failed for title: Aviation photography
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give some examples of backgrounds that would be considered good or bad in air-to-air photography, and why?', 'question': 'Considering the importance of selecting an appropriate background in air-to-air aviation photography to either highlight or avoid distracting from the subject aircraft, what are some specific examples of backgrounds that would be considered effective or ineffective, and what are the reasons for their suitability or unsuitability?', 'answer': "The document doesn't provide specific examples of good or bad backgrounds, but it mentions that the background should highlight the subject and not be distracting.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references a document ('The document doesn't provide...'), which violates the rule to never mention that a document was provided. Additionally, the Answer fails to provide concrete examples of backgrounds as requested by the Question, making it not fully relevant or useful relative to the RAG_input.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: William Horman
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What was the main argument in the Antibossicon?', 'question': 'Given that William Horman published Antibossicon G. Hormani ad G. Lilium in response to criticism of his Vulgaria, what was the central argument or topic addressed in Antibossicon?', 'answer': 'It takes the form of a series of letters to Horman , and from him to William Lilye , another grammarian who supported the new teaching approach . Lilye also published an Antibossicum , and the two were published together as a pamphlet .', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer describes the form and publication relationship of Antibossicon (a series of letters between Horman and Lilye) rather than stating the main argument or topic. The question asks for the central argument addressed in Antibossicon, which is a defense of Horman's teaching approach and response to criticism of the Vulgaria. Therefore the answer is not correct.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Accounting rate of return
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give an example of how depreciation methods could be manipulated?', 'question': 'Given the discussion that the accounting rate of return can be manipulated through changes in depreciation methods, can you provide an example of how these methods could be manipulated to influence the ARR?', 'answer': 'The change of methods for depreciation can be manipulated and lead to higher profits.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide a concrete example; it only states that depreciation method changes can manipulate ARR without giving a specific, step-by-step example of how to do it.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Jewish wedding
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is it read aloud?', 'question': 'Is the ketubah read aloud during the Jewish wedding ceremony?', 'answer': 'Under the chuppah, it is traditional to read the signed ketubah aloud.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is too vague and lacks explicit subject/context; it does not clearly build on a prior turn or specify what is being read aloud. As a result, the provided Question cannot be considered a faithful standalone rephrase of the RAG_input. The mismatch violates the requirement that the Question be a standalone, context-rich rephrasing of the RAG_input (Rules 1 and 2).

Class: RAG_InputNotConnected

Validation failed for title: Benedict's reagent
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What colors indicate different concentrations?', 'question': "Following the use of Benedict's reagent to detect reducing sugars, what colors indicate the different concentrations of reducing sugars present in a sample?", 'answer': 'A greenish precipitate indicates about 0.5 g % concentration; yellow precipitate indicates 1 g % concentration; orange indicates 1.5 g % and red indicates 2 g % or higher concentration.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is too vague and not clearly anchored to the prior turn; it lacks the Benedict's reagent/reducing-sugars context. The Question should be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input, but it adds Benedict's reagent and reducing-sugars context that are not present in the rag_input, making it not a faithful standalone rephrase and potentially not properly contextually connected to the prior turn.

Class: RAG_InputNotConnected

Validation failed for title: Benedict's reagent
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Why does sucrose react after adding acid?', 'question': "Considering that sucrose does not directly react with Benedict's reagent, why does it produce a positive reaction after being heated with dilute hydrochloric acid?", 'answer': "The acidic conditions and heat break the glycosidic bond in sucrose through hydrolysis. The products of sucrose decomposition are glucose and fructose, both of which can be detected by Benedict's reagent.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not a faithful standalone rephrase of the RAG_input. It adds context about Benedict's reagent and a positive test, which is not present in the original 'rag_input'. A standalone rephrase should restate 'Why does sucrose react after adding acid?' without introducing new context or references to Benedict's reagent.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Textile industry in India
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does that compare to the cotton sector?', 'question': "What percentage of India's total cloth production is attributed to the cotton sector, and how does that compare to the 13% attributed to the handloom sector?", 'answer': 'The document states that the cotton sector is the second most developed sector in the Indian Textile industries. It does not give a percentage of total cloth production.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: Fails Rule 1: the Answer text references 'the document', which is prohibited. The Answer should be self-contained and not mention that a document was provided.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: Textile industry in India
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are the major challenges for the jute industry?', 'question': "Given that man-made fibers account for 62% and cotton for 60% of India's textile production, and the handloom sector accounts for 13% of India's total cloth production, what are the major challenges faced by the jute industry in India?", 'answer': 'The challenges faced by the jute industry include stiff competition in the international market from synthetic substitutes and from other countries such as Bangladesh, Brazil, Philippines, Egypt and Thailand. However, the internal demand has been on the rise due to Government policy of mandatory use of jute packaging. To stimulate demand, the products need to be diversified.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is not contextually connected to the prior turn; it is standalone and does not clearly build on the preceding discussion about the shares of textile sectors (man-made fibers, cotton, handloom). For compliance, the rag_input should embed that prior context so it clearly builds on the previous turn. The provided rag_input simply asks about jute challenges without linking to earlier numbers or conclusions.

Class: RAG_InputNotConnected

Validation failed for title: Hydrate
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there other ways water can be incorporated into a substance besides forming hydrates like ethanol or chloral hydrate?', 'question': 'Given the previous discussion of hydrates such as ethanol and chloral hydrate, are there other ways water can be incorporated into a substance?', 'answer': 'Yes, many organic and inorganic molecules form crystals that incorporate water into the crystalline structure without chemical alteration of the organic molecule; this is called water of crystallization.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Rule violation: The Question is not standalone (it cites 'the previous discussion' rather than being understandable without history). Additionally, the Answer does not address 'other ways water can be incorporated into a substance besides forming hydrates' and instead reiterates hydrates (water of crystallization), failing to provide a correct and complete response to the standalone question.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Hydrate
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What happens if an inorganic hydrate loses its water?', 'question': 'Given that inorganic compounds can form hydrates with water of crystallization, what is the result if an inorganic hydrate loses this water?', 'answer': 'A hydrate which has lost water is referred to as an anhydride; the remaining water, if any exists, can only be removed with very strong heating. A substance that does not contain any water is referred to as anhydrous.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer uses incorrect terminology: a dehydrated hydrate becomes an anhydrous compound, not an 'anhydride'. The term 'anhydride' is used for different species. Additionally, the claim that any remaining water can only be removed with 'very strong heating' is not generally correct; dehydration of hydrates often occurs with moderate heating, and the product is typically the anhydrous compound.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Hydrate
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's the difference between an anhydride and an anhydrous substance, then?", 'question': 'Given that a hydrate becomes an anhydride after losing some water, and an anhydrous substance contains no water, what is the difference between an anhydride and an anhydrous substance?', 'answer': 'A hydrate which has lost water is referred to as an anhydride; a substance that does not contain any water is referred to as anhydrous.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The provided Answer incorrectly states that a dehydrated hydrate becomes an 'anhydride'. The correct term is 'anhydrous' (a substance with no water). An 'anhydride' is a different class of compound, typically formed by the removal of water between two acid molecules or by condensation of an oxide with water, and is not the result of simply dehydrating a hydrate.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Penobscot River
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What is the average discharge rate of the Penobscot River?', 'question': 'What is the average discharge rate of the Penobscot River?', 'answer': 'The average discharge rate is 12,080 cu ft/s (342 m/s).'}
Reason: The question matches the RAG_input exactly, and the context relates to the provided Penobscot River document. However, the answer is not correct due to a unit error: 12,080 cubic feet per second equals about 342 cubic meters per second, not 342 meters per second. The correct phrasing is: 'The average discharge rate is 12,080 cu ft/s (342 m^3/s).'

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Penobscot River
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is it navigable up to a certain point?', 'question': 'Given that the Penobscot River empties into the Atlantic Ocean in Penobscot Bay, is the Penobscot River navigable up to a certain point?', 'answer': 'Yes, the Penobscot flows south past the city of Bangor, where it becomes navigable.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The rag_input and Question are not identical; the required format for the first turn mandates that Question be exactly the rag_input. Additionally, the rag_input itself is not context-rich or self-contained, whereas the Question should be a standalone, context-rich restatement. This mismatch violates the stated rules for the initial turn.

Class: questionNotConsistent

Validation failed for title: General Hospital cast members
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was it the same person as 2012?', 'question': 'Was the actor who played Todd Manning in 2013 the same actor, Roger Howarth, who played him in 2012?', 'answer': 'Yes', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' must be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input and not identical to it. In this case, the 'Question' is identical to the 'rag_input', which violates the requirement that it be a rephrasing that provides context suitable for standalone understanding.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: General Hospital cast members
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, did he leave the show in 2013?', 'question': "Given our previous discussion about the character Todd Manning, and assuming that Roger Howarth played him in both 2012 and 2013, did Roger Howarth's portrayal of Todd Manning end in 2013, signifying his departure from General Hospital at that time?", 'answer': 'Yes', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it references 'our previous discussion' and introduces assumptions about 2012/2013, thus requiring prior turns. It should be a self-contained rephrasing of the rag_input without relying on prior conversation.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Sadness
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What about in 'Lord of the Rings'?", 'question': "Given that Edmund Spenser viewed sadness as a marker of spiritual commitment, what perspective on sadness is presented in J.R.R. Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'?", 'answer': "In The Lord of the Rings, sadness is distinguished from unhappiness, to exemplify J.R.R. Tolkien's preference for a sad, but settled determination, as opposed to what he saw as the shallower temptations of either despair or hope.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Schema field names and casing are incorrect. The required fields are: 'rag_input', 'Question', 'Type', and 'Answer'. The provided input uses lowercase 'type', 'question', and 'answer', which violates the mandated format.

Class: formatIssues

Validation failed for title: National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who were the other founders?', 'question': 'Besides Oliver Kelley, who were the other individuals who co-founded the National Grange, which was intended to bring people from the North and South together in a spirit of mutual cooperation to address the economic and social challenges faced by farmers?', 'answer': 'William Saunders, Francis M. McDowell, John Trimble, Aaron B. Grosh, John R. Thompson, William M. Ireland, and Caroline Hall.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The rag_input in the rag_to_be_tested output does not match the provided RAG_input ('Who were the other founders?'). It instead asks about the founding date and who commissioned Oliver Kelley, failing requirement to build on the given input and to rephrase it as a standalone question about the other founders. The 'Question' is not a correct standalone rephrase of the RAG_input, so the content is inconsistent with the prompt.

Class: questionNotConsistent

Validation failed for title: Accord and satisfaction
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So the builder can choose which contract to sue under? What dictates that choice?', 'question': 'Given that a builder, after an accord agreement, can choose to sue under either the original contract or the new accord contract if the homeowner breaches the accord, what factors determine which contract the builder should choose to sue under?', 'answer': 'The non-offending party has the right to sue under either the original contract or the accord agreement. There is no specification in the document about what dictates that choice.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the Question's request for factors that determine which contract to sue under after an accord. It simply asserts a general right to sue under either contract and claims no specification exists, but it provides no concrete criteria or factors (e.g., whether satisfaction has occurred, remedies available, risk of double recovery, or strategic considerations) that would guide the builder's choice. This fails to give a relevant, actionable answer to the standalone question.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Stratovolcano
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does that affect the hazard posed by Nyiragongo?', 'question': 'Given that Mount Nyiragongo has unusually fluid lava flows compared to other stratovolcanoes, how does this difference in lava viscosity affect the potential hazards associated with its eruptions?', 'answer': "Lava flows could melt down ice and glaciers that accumulated on the volcano 's crater and upper slopes , generating massive lahar flows .", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer asserts that Nyiragongo's lava flows would melt ice/glaciers on the crater and upper slopes to generate massive lahars. Mount Nyiragongo is near the equator and does not have permanent glaciers, so ice-melt lahars are not a realistic hazard there. A correct answer would address hazards from low-viscosity lava (rapid lava flows, potential devastation) without invoking ice-melt lahars.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Sperm motility
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does DNA damage affect that velocity?', 'question': "Considering that the typical velocity of sperm can change and is affected by factors like intracellular ion concentration, pH, and hyperactivation, how does sperm DNA damage affect the sperm's velocity?", 'answer': 'About 31% of men with sperm motility defects have high levels of sperm DNA fragmentation.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Answer' does not address how DNA damage affects sperm velocity. It provides a prevalence statistic (31% of men with motility defects have high sperm DNA fragmentation) rather than explaining the impact of DNA damage on velocity or motility dynamics. A correct answer should describe how DNA fragmentation or damage influences velocity, such as potential reductions in speed, altered motility patterns, or changes in hyperactivation-related motion.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Sperm motility
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What classifications of motility are there?', 'question': 'Given that abnormal sperm motility is linked to DNA damage, what are the different classifications of sperm motility?', 'answer': 'Straight moving, Zig - zag moving, Vibrating, Non-motile', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question does not faithfully rephrase the RAG_input as a standalone prompt; it adds extraneous context about DNA damage that is not present in the RAG_input. Additionally, the RAG_input itself is not clearly shown as building on the prior turn in this exchange.

Class: questionNotConsistent

Validation failed for title: Veil of ignorance
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are some criticisms of the veil of ignorance?', 'question': "Considering Rawls' veil of ignorance and its relation to the social contract, what are some criticisms leveled against this philosophical concept?", 'answer': "The document doesn't explicitly detail criticisms of the veil of ignorance. However, it mentions John Harsanyi's argument that it favors utilitarianism over social contract theory.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not adequately fulfill the request. It claims the document doesn't detail criticisms, which is not accurate given prior context that mentions a critique (Harsanyi's view that the veil of ignorance leans toward utilitarianism). Additionally, it provides only a single, limited criticism instead of multiple criticisms, failing to fully address 'some criticisms' of the concept.

Class: Groundtruth

Validation failed for title: Veil of ignorance
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Didn't you mention Harsanyi's view on utilitarianism earlier?", 'question': "Given our previous discussion about Rawls' veil of ignorance and social contract theory, didn't you previously mention John Harsanyi's view on utilitarianism as a criticism of the veil of ignorance?", 'answer': 'Yes, John Harsanyi argued that the veil of ignorance favors utilitarianism rather than a social contract.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The Question is not self-contained; it relies on prior dialogue ('our previous discussion') to be understood. It should be a standalone restatement of the RAG_input that can be understood without any history. It should not reference past conversations. The provided Question fails this standalone requirement.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Veil of ignorance
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does utilitarianism differ from a social contract approach in this context?', 'question': "Given that Harsanyi argued Rawls' veil of ignorance favors utilitarianism over a social contract, how does utilitarianism fundamentally differ from a social contract approach in the context of determining justice and fairness in society?", 'answer': 'The document suggests that utilitarianism, in contrast to a social contract approach, focuses on maximizing overall welfare rather than primarily establishing a framework based on agreed-upon principles of social cooperation and individual rights. The social contract focuses on establishing fair terms of cooperation, while utilitarianism is concerned with the overall good.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer text uses 'The document suggests...', which violates the rule of never mentioning that a document was provided. The input must present a self-contained RAG_input/Question/Answer set without referencing external documents. Additionally, while the Question is a comparative restatement, the primary failure is the document reference in the Answer.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: Oncogene
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there other examples of chromosomal translocations that lead to oncogene activation?', 'question': 'Besides the Philadelphia chromosome, are there other examples of chromosomal translocations that lead to the activation of oncogenes and contribute to cancer development?', 'answer': "Yes, the document mentions that translocation events can relocate a proto-oncogene to a new chromosomal site that leads to higher expression, or create a fusion between a proto-oncogene and another gene, resulting in a constitutively active hybrid protein. It also mentions the MYC gene's implication in Burkitt's lymphoma, where a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence near the MYC gene, increasing transcription factor production.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer text refers to 'the document', which violates the rule that the response must be self-contained and not mention that a document was provided. It should answer the question without referencing sources.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: Oncogene
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any treatments that specifically target these translocation-related oncogenes?', 'question': "Given that chromosomal translocations like the Philadelphia chromosome in CML and the MYC translocation in Burkitt's lymphoma lead to oncogene activation and uncontrolled cell proliferation, are there any treatments specifically designed to target the resulting oncogenes or their activity?", 'answer': "The document mentions that many cancer drugs target the proteins encoded by oncogenes. While it doesn't specify treatments for the BCR-ABL or MYC translocations, the implication is that targeting these proteins is a valid therapeutic strategy.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document', which violates the rule that the Answer must be self-contained and not mention that a document was provided. It should directly answer based on the RAG_input without citing sources. Additionally, providing concrete examples (e.g., TKIs like imatinib for BCR-ABL) would make the response more informative.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: Oncogene
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about treatments targeting overexpressed oncogenes, not just fusion proteins?', 'question': "We've discussed treatments for fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal translocations, like TKIs for BCR-ABL in CML. Are there also treatment strategies specifically designed to target oncogenes that are overexpressed due to translocations placing them near strong promoters, such as the MYC gene in Burkitt's lymphoma?", 'answer': 'The document suggests that antisense messenger RNAs could theoretically be used to block the effects of oncogenes. This could potentially target overexpressed oncogenes by reducing their mRNA levels. Additionally, the classification section mentions drugs targeting various proteins involved in cell proliferation, like those affecting growth factors, receptor tyrosine kinases, cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, and transcription factors, which could be relevant for overexpressed oncogenes.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document' and 'classification section', which makes it non-self-contained and violates the requirement to avoid mentioning provided documents. It should provide a standalone answer describing concrete strategies to target overexpressed oncogenes arising from translocations (e.g., transcriptional repression, RNA interference, BET inhibitors affecting MYC regulation), rather than citing sources. Additionally, the Answer should be directly relevant to the RAG_input without referencing external documents.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: Irrigation tank
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there specific examples of successful tank revitalization projects?', 'question': 'Given the discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of tank irrigation in South India, are there specific examples of successful tank revitalization projects that have overcome some of these disadvantages?', 'answer': "Yes, Ralegaon Siddhi is an example of a village that revitalized its ancient tank system. In 1975, the village was drought-stricken, and the village tank could not hold water. The villagers repaired the embankment, and the village's wells filled with water, providing a year-round water supply.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not fully standalone; it relies on prior discussion/context ('Given the discussion about the advantages and disadvantages...'), whereas it should be a self-contained rephrase of the RAG_input. A compliant version would be a self-contained rephrase of 'Are there specific examples of successful tank revitalization projects?' without referencing prior turns or discussions.

Validation failed for title: Mach Five
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, besides the hood, what were some other major design changes in the 1993 remake?', 'question': "Given that the 'M' hood design was unique to the original Mach Five and changed in the 1993 American remake, what were some other major design changes implemented in that remake?", 'answer': "The document doesn't specify other design changes beyond the hood in the 1993 remake.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The answer claims no other design changes beyond the hood, but the referenced context indicates that the 1993 remake completely changed the Mach Five's design. The response is therefore incorrect and incomplete.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Mach Five
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did the original series ever showcase racing combat, or was it strictly about speed and skill?', 'question': 'Given that the 1993 American remake emphasized racing combat, did the original 1967 series ever showcase racing combat elements, or was it strictly focused on speed and driving skill?', 'answer': 'The original series did include elements that could be considered racing combat, such as using the cutter blades to remove obstacles and the auto jacks for evasive maneuvers, although the focus was more on overcoming obstacles and challenges than direct combat with other racers.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer asserts that the original 1967 Mach Five included racing-combat elements (cutter blades for obstacles and auto jacks for evasive maneuvers) and that it involved direct combat with other racers. In canon, the original series focused on speed and driving skill with gadgets primarily for obstacle navigation; there was no emphasis on direct combat with rivals. Racing combat is more associated with the 1993 remake. Therefore the Answer is factually incorrect and does not properly address the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is this proverb found anywhere besides the Bible?', 'question': "The proverb 'As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly' means that fools are stubbornly inflexible and tend to repeat their mistakes or wrong behaviors despite the negative consequences, much like a dog returning to its vomit. Is this proverb found anywhere besides the Bible, which you mentioned earlier?", 'answer': "Yes, it's quoted in the New Testament, 2 Peter 2:22. Kipling cites it in his poem The Gods of the Copybook Headings. It's also used by Ken Livingstone and Paul Keating.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone: it references prior context with 'which you mentioned earlier' and restates the proverb's meaning, making it dependent on the prior turn rather than self-contained. Additionally, the Answer does not align with the standalone question: the question asks for sources outside the Bible, but the Answer cites a Bible passage (2 Peter 2:22) and only mentions non-Bible usages secondarily, which does not satisfy the requirement to identify non-Biblical occurrences.

Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'I thought you said they were the first successful tractor company in the US?', 'question': "Given the previous discussion about Charles City's role in tractor history and the establishment of Hart-Parr as the first successful tractor company in the US, are you now saying that you don't have any information about what happened to that company?", 'answer': 'In 1929, Hart-Parr was one of the four companies that merged to form Oliver Farm Equipment Company and finally the White Farm - New Idea Equipment Co . At its peak in the mid-1970s , the sprawling plant complex encompassed 23 acres and employed nearly 3,000 workers . The 1980s farm crisis and other economic pressures led to the closing of the plant in 1993 . As of 2013 , the vacant site stands ready for re-use.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is not self-contained; it relies on referencing 'the previous discussion' and contextual details rather than being a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input. The Rule requires the Question to be a self-contained restatement of the rag_input with necessary context, without referring to prior conversations.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Charles City, Iowa
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "No, I'm still talking about Hart-Parr in Charles City. What happened to *them*?", 'question': "Considering we've been discussing Charles City and the Hart-Parr Gasoline Engine Company, which was the first successful tractor company in the U.S., what eventually happened to Hart-Parr?", 'answer': 'In 1929, Hart-Parr was one of the four companies that merged to form Oliver Farm Equipment Company and finally the White Farm - New Idea Equipment Co .

The 1980s farm crisis and other economic pressures led to the closing of the plant in 1993 . As of 2013 , the vacant site stands ready for re-use.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The 'Type' is incorrect for this rag_input. The input is a follow-up/clarification asking what happened to Hart-Parr after prior discussion, which fits Follow-up or Clarification. 'Correction' implies pointing out an error in a previous answer, which is not indicated by the rag_input. The rag_input, Question, and Answer themselves are coherent and self-contained.

Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, political pressure can override the guidelines?', 'question': 'Based on the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), it seems that the installation of all-way stops should be based on traffic engineering studies and safety criteria. However, can political pressure from residents override these guidelines in the placement of all-way stops?', 'answer': 'Despite published guidelines , all - way stops are routinely placed by jurisdictions due to political pressure from adjacent residents.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The 'Question' rephrasing mentions a specific document (the MUTCD), which violates the requirement that the standalone question must not refer to any document; it should be self-contained and not cite sources.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: Tax incidence
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'And what about perfectly elastic supply?', 'question': "Given that tax incidence depends on the price elasticity of supply and demand, and we've discussed perfectly inelastic demand, what is the impact on tax incidence if the supply is perfectly elastic?", 'answer': 'With perfectly elastic supply, the consumer bears the entire burden of the tax.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it refers to prior discussion about perfectly inelastic demand ('we've discussed perfectly inelastic demand'), which makes it rely on history. A valid Question should be a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input, not require previous turns or mention prior conversations.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Tax incidence
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, elasticity really determines who pays, right?', 'question': "Given that we've discussed how perfectly elastic supply and perfectly inelastic demand affect who pays a tax, does the elasticity of supply and demand primarily determine the tax incidence?", 'answer': 'Yes, the relative price elasticities of supply and demand are the primary determinants of tax incidence. The group with the more inelastic curve bears a larger portion of the tax burden.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone; it relies on prior conversation ('Given that we've discussed...') and includes specifics (perfectly elastic supply and perfectly inelastic demand) not present in the RAG_input. It should be a self-contained rephrase of the rag_input without referencing history.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Chinese fire drill
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about the foul ball definition of it?', 'question': "Considering that 'Chinese home run' can also refer to a foul ball hit high and backward, is that definition of the term also considered offensive or dated?", 'answer': 'The latter is still used in the U.S. region of New England.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the standalone Question about whether the foul ball definition is offensive or dated; it only notes regional usage and does not state the offensiveness or dating status as requested.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Don't Come Around Here No More
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who played Alice in it?', 'question': 'Who played the character of Alice in the music video for "Don\'t Come Around Here No More"?', 'answer': "Louise `` Wish '' Foley played Alice.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is not clear: 'Who played Alice in it?' uses an ambiguous pronoun without identifying the subject (which video or work). To meet rule 1, the RAG_input should be explicit (e.g., referencing the specific music video) while remaining contextually connected to prior turns.

Class: RAG_InputNotConnected

Validation failed for title: Don't Come Around Here No More
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What role did Dave Stewart have in the video?', 'question': 'Given the information about the music video for "Don\'t Come Around Here No More", who directed the video, what happened to Alice, what role did Dave Stewart have in the video?', 'answer': 'Dave Stewart appears as the caterpillar at the beginning , sitting on a mushroom with a hookah water pipe while playing a sitar.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a faithful standalone rephrase of the RAG_input; it adds extra topics (who directed the video, what happened to Alice) beyond the original question about Dave Stewart's role, violating the requirement that the Question be a standalone rephrase of the RAG_input.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Tar Heel
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any specific events that led to the change in perception?', 'question': "Given that the term 'Tar Heel' transitioned from derogatory to a source of pride around 1865, were there any specific events or factors that contributed to this shift in perception?", 'answer': 'The document mentions legendary explanations related to the Civil War, such as North Carolina troops holding their ground in battle while others retreated, and soldiers sticking to their ranks like they had tar on their heels. These likely contributed to the reappropriation of the term.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the document,' which violates the rule to avoid mentioning documents. It also provides only a vague description of Civil War legends rather than identifying concrete events or factors around 1865 that contributed to the shift in perception.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: Tar Heel
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any dissenting opinions on embracing the term?', 'question': "Given the information that the term 'Tar Heel' was embraced as a point of pride, were there any individuals or groups who held dissenting opinions or resisted the positive re-appropriation of the term?", 'answer': 'The 1884 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica reported that people who lived in the region of pine forests were "far superior to the tar heel, the nickname of the dwellers in barrens."', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not address the Question about dissenting opinions or resistors to the positive re-appropriation of the term. It instead cites a single, pejorative quote about pine-forest inhabitants, which does not identify any individuals or groups who opposed embracing the term. The RAG_input, Question, and Type are appropriately aligned, but the Answer fails to be relevant or directly fact-based regarding dissent.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Tar Heel
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Were there any attempts to change the nickname?', 'question': "Given the history of the 'Tar Heel' nickname, including its derogatory origins and eventual embrace, were there any documented attempts or proposals to change the nickname to something else?", 'answer': 'The provided text does not mention any attempts to change the nickname.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references 'the provided text,' which violates the rule to avoid mentioning documents. Additionally, it asserts no documented attempts without providing a self-contained justification.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: First day of school
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any other specific traditions?', 'question': 'Besides bringing flowers to teachers, are there any other specific traditions associated with Knowledge Day in Russia?', 'answer': 'The document does not mention any other specific traditions besides bringing flowers to teachers and the ceremonial line-up if September 1st falls on a Sunday.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer references a document: 'The document does not mention...' This violates the rule to avoid mentioning that a document was provided. The answer should be self-contained. A correct version would state no other traditions without referencing a document (e.g., 'No other traditions are listed beyond bringing flowers to teachers and the Sunday ceremony if September 1 falls on a Sunday.').

Class: documentmentioned

Validation failed for title: First day of school
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Is it a holiday?', 'question': 'Given that Knowledge Day is celebrated on the first day of school in Russia, is it considered a public holiday?', 'answer': 'The document does not explicitly state whether Knowledge Day is a public holiday.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide a direct factual answer to the Question and instead references a document. It should be a self-contained, factual response indicating whether Knowledge Day is considered a public holiday. Referencing a document violates the format and the requirement for an accurate, standalone answer.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Molasses Act
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was the act successful in raising revenue?', 'question': 'According to the provided information, was the Molasses Act successful in raising revenue?', 'answer': 'No, the Act was not passed for the purpose of raising revenue, but rather to regulate trade.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. It adds meta-text ('According to the provided information') and explicitly references 'Molasses Act', making it rely on prior context. A proper standalone rephrase would be self-contained, e.g., 'Was the Molasses Act successful in raising revenue?' without meta references.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Jamie Lloyd
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So, is she still considered part of the canon?', 'question': 'Given that Jamie Lloyd dies in Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers in two different ways depending on the film version, is the character of Jamie Lloyd still considered part of the Halloween canon in subsequent films?', 'answer': 'No, to focus more on the Laurie Strode character, the events of parts 4, 5, and 6 are written out of the continuity, thus erasing the Jamie Lloyd character from the canon.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question does not faithfully rephrase the RAG_input; it adds new detail (Jamie Lloyd dies in Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers in two different ways) that wasn't in the RAG_input, making the Question not a standalone rephrasing. This violates Rule 2. The Type and Answer are otherwise acceptable given the provided content.

Class: questionNotConsistent

Validation failed for title: Mining industry of Nigeria
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'When was the Ministry established?', 'question': 'When was the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development established in Nigeria?', 'answer': 'The document does not provide the establishment date of the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer does not provide the actual establishment date (or a clear not-available indicator) for the Ministry. It simply states that the information is not provided, which does not give a factual date or a proper not-specified response. The standalone Question requires a specific date or a definitive note that the date is not available.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Mining industry of Nigeria
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What are the main provisions of that act?', 'question': 'What are some of the main provisions outlined in the Federal Minerals and Mining Act of 1999 in Nigeria?', 'answer': 'The document does not outline the specific provisions of the Federal Minerals and Mining Act of 1999.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer claims there are no provisions outlined in the act, which is incorrect given the Question asks for the main provisions. The Answer should summarize key provisions (e.g., government ownership of mineral resources, licensing/regulation, exploration/mining rights, royalties/fees, environmental/regulatory requirements) rather than deny their existence.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Morpheme
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can you give an example of a word with three morphemes?', 'question': 'Given that a morpheme is the smallest grammatical unit in a language, and morphology is the study of morphemes, can you provide an example of a word that is composed of three morphemes?', 'answer': "Unbreakable is an example of a word with three morphemes: un- (a bound morpheme signifying 'not'), -break- (the root, a free morpheme), and -able (a bound morpheme signifying 'can be done').", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input does not clearly build on the prior turn; it is standalone rather than a context-aware follow-up. The rules require the RAG_input to be clearly connected to the previous interaction (not standalone).

Class: RAG_InputNotConnected

Validation failed for title: Free agent
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does that compare to a restricted free agent in the NFL?', 'question': 'How does being an undrafted free agent in the NFL compare to being a restricted free agent in the NFL regarding the ability to negotiate with teams?', 'answer': 'Restricted free agents (RFAs) are players who have three accrued seasons of service and whose contracts have expired. RFAs have received qualifying offers from their old clubs and are free to negotiate with any club until a deadline which occurs approximately a week prior to the NFL Draft, at which time their rights revert to their original club. If a player accepts an offer from a new club, the old club will have the right to match the offer and retain the player.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The provided Answer only describes restricted free agents and their negotiation rights, but does not compare to undrafted free agents. The question asks for a comparative assessment of negotiation ability between undrafted free agents (who can negotiate with any team) and restricted free agents (whose negotiation is constrained by a qualifying offer and potential matching by the original team).

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Free agent
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What happens if a restricted free agent doesn't receive a qualifying offer?", 'question': "Considering the negotiating differences between undrafted, restricted, and unrestricted free agents in the NFL, what happens to a player's status and negotiating rights if they would normally be a restricted free agent, but their original team does not provide them with a qualifying offer?", 'answer': "The document does not specify what happens if a restricted free agent doesn't receive a qualifying offer.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The provided answer claims there is no specification. However, NFL rules state that if a restricted free agent does not receive a qualifying offer, they become an unrestricted free agent and can negotiate with any team (no compensation to the original team). Therefore, the answer is incorrect.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Free agent
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about Major League Baseball?', 'question': 'Considering that different leagues have different deadlines for free agents, what are the specific deadlines or important dates related to free agency in Major League Baseball (MLB)?', 'answer': "The document mentions some rules that are included in MLB free agency, and details about the collective bargaining agreement signed on November 22, 2011, but it doesn't specify any hard deadlines other than that players with six or more years of major-league service (on the team 's 40 - man roster ) and not under contract for the following season is automatically a free agent.", 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The RAG_input is too vague and not clearly contextually connected to the prior turn; it does not convincingly build on the preceding discussion about free-agency rules. Additionally, the Answer is factually incomplete/incorrect in portraying MLB free agency as having no hard deadlines beyond six years of service; MLB has additional rules and timing considerations (e.g., arbitration processes, contract timing, and other CBA provisions) that create practical deadlines and dates related to free agency.

Class: RAG_InputNotConnected

Validation failed for title: David Hale (Sons of Anarchy)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Didn't Clay Morrow want Unser to stay in his position?", 'question': "Earlier we discussed David Hale wanting Unser out of his position as Chief of Police. Didn't Clay Morrow, the leader of SAMCRO, actually want Unser to stay in his position?", 'answer': "Yes, Clay Morrow wanted Unser to continue as police Chief in order to ensure Hale didn't assume the position and become a threat to SAMCRO and their allies.", 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: Rule 2 violated: The Question is not standalone. It references prior discussion and adds context about David Hale, making it require history to understand. It should be a self-contained restatement of the RAG_input without relying on prior turns or external context.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Age of marriage in the United States
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What is the youngest age a girl could be married in Tennessee in 2000?', 'question': 'What is the youngest age a girl could be married in Tennessee in 2000?', 'answer': 'Girls as young as 10 were married in Tennessee in 2001.'}
Reason: The question asks about the youngest age in Tennessee in 2000, but the provided document only states that girls as young as 10 were married in Tennessee in 2001; there is no information about 2000. Therefore the given answer is not correct for the year 2000.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Age of marriage in the United States
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Are there any states with no statutory minimum age under any circumstances?', 'question': 'Following the discussion about the general age of marriage in the US, are there any states that have no statutory minimum age for marriage, even with exceptions like parental or judicial consent?', 'answer': 'No, Delaware and New Jersey have a clear minimum age of 18 with no exceptions.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not standalone: it begins with 'Following the discussion...' which references prior turns, violating the standalone requirement. The rag_input is not explicitly tied to marriage (it should clearly reference marriage to maintain context). The Answer does not correctly address the rag_input: the question asks whether any states have no statutory minimum age under any circumstances (i.e., no statutory minimum age in statute, potentially with other mechanisms), whereas the provided answer focuses on Delaware and New Jersey having a fixed minimum age with no exceptions, thus not answering the intended question.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Age of marriage in the United States
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which state has the lowest statutory minimum age, considering all exceptions?', 'question': 'Considering the previous discussion about the age of marriage and the possibility of exceptions like parental consent, which U.S. state has the absolute lowest statutory minimum age for marriage when all potential exceptions are taken into account?', 'answer': 'Multiple states have statutory minimum ages of 14 or 15 with exceptions. Alabama is 16, Alaska is 14, Arizona is 16, Connecticut is 16, Florida is 17, Georgia is 16, Hawaii is 15, Illinois is 16, Indiana is 15, Iowa is 16, Kansas is 15, Kentucky is 17, Maryland is 15, Minnesota is 16, Missouri is 16, Montana is 16, New Hampshire is 16, New York is 17, North Carolina is 14, North Dakota is 16, Oregon is 17, South Carolina is 16/None, South Dakota is 16, Tennessee is 17, Texas is 16, Utah is 15, Vermont is 16, Virginia is 16.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is not standalone; it references 'the previous discussion' and thus fails requirement 2. A standalone rephrase should be self-contained and understandable without any prior turns or context. The RAG_input should be reformulated so the Question can be answered without referencing earlier conversation.

Class: notStandalone

Validation failed for title: Age of marriage in the United States
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "What's the youngest age at which someone *can* legally marry right now, in any state?", 'question': 'Considering current marriage laws across all U.S. states, including any exceptions for parental consent or judicial approval, what is the absolute youngest age at which someone can legally get married in any state today?', 'answer': '14. In North Carolina and Alaska, the minimum age is 14 with exceptions.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer is incomplete/incorrect. The rag_input asks for the absolute youngest age across all states today, including exceptions. Citing only North Carolina and Alaska (14) omits other states that also have a 14-year-old minimum under certain conditions or jurisdictions, and it may misrepresent states where no statutory minimum exists but exceptions apply. Therefore, the provided Answer is not factually correct or sufficiently complete.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Out of left field
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "So, the music industry used it differently than to mean 'disoriented'?", 'question': "Is the use of the phrase 'out of left field' in the music industry different from its use to mean 'disoriented'?", 'answer': "Popular music historian Arnold Shaw wrote in 1949 for the Music Library Association that the term ``out of left field '' was first used in the idiomatic sense of `` from out of nowhere '' by the music industry to refer to a song that unexpectedly performed well in the market .", 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The provided Question references a specific document (the 1961 article in American Speech), which violates the rule to avoid mentioning documents. The Question should be a standalone rephrase of the RAG_input without any reference to particular sources.

Class: documentMentioned

Validation failed for title: Out of left field
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Did the baseball usage come before either of those?', 'question': "Did the baseball origins of the phrase 'out of left field' predate its use in the music industry or to mean 'disoriented'?", 'answer': 'The phrase came from baseball terminology referring to the area covered by the left fielder who has the farthest throw to first base.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The provided Answer only states the baseball origin and does not address whether it predates the later music-industry use or the meaning 'disoriented' (the Comparative Question). It fails to give the ground-truth answer to the RAG_input by not making a clear comparative temporal claim (predates yes/no) and by not providing the required timeframe or context for the comparison.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Sun path
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How does that compare to the summer solstice in the same hemisphere?', 'question': "How does the sun's path in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter solstice compare to the sun's path during the summer solstice?", 'answer': 'In the Northern Hemisphere , the sun path near to the summer solstice (May, June, July), the Sun rises in the northeast, peaks out slightly south of overhead point (lower in the south at higher latitude), and then sets in the northwest, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere the sun path near the summer solstice (November, December, January) , the Sun rises in the southeast, peaks out slightly north of overhead point (lower in the north at higher latitude), and then sets in the southwest.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: Multiple rule violations: (1) RAG_input must clearly build on the prior turn; the rag_input here reads as a standalone query and does not clearly connect to prior context. (2) Question must be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input and not identical to it; here the Question is identical to the rag_input. (3) Type must match the nature of the Question; the Question is not clearly comparative, yet Type is declared as Comparative. (4) Answer contains a minor factual inaccuracy (noon sun altitude at winter solstice in the tropics is about 43°, not strictly 'more than 43°'), and combined with the other violations, the input fails the overall validation.

Class: GroundTruth

Validation failed for title: Sun path
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What about the Southern Hemisphere during its winter solstice?', 'question': 'Considering that north-facing windows are ineffective for solar heating in the Northern Hemisphere during its winter, what is the effectiveness of north-facing windows for solar heating in the Southern Hemisphere during its winter solstice?', 'answer': 'For comparison, the sun path near the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere (May, June, July) rises in the northeast, peaks out at a low angle in the north (more than halfway up from the horizon in the tropics), and then sets in the northwest. There, the north-facing window would let in plenty of solar thermal energy to the house.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Question is not a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input. It introduces new context about north-facing windows in the Northern Hemisphere and references prior content, which makes it not self-contained. The RAG_input asks about the Southern Hemisphere during its winter solstice, and the Question should restate that clearly without relying on history or previous statements.
