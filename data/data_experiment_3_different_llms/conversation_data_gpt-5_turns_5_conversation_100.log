Validation failed for title: Fire triangle
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Briefly distinguish surface cooling vs gas/smoke cooling when using water, and state the droplet size needed for effective gas-phase cooling.', 'question': 'When using water to fight fires, what is the difference between surface cooling of solid fuels and gas/smoke (gas-phase) cooling, and what approximate droplet size is required for effective gas-phase cooling?', 'answer': 'Surface cooling: Water applied to solid fuels evaporates and removes heat from the fuel surface, cooling it and halting pyrolysis, thereby cutting off fuel to the flames. Gas/smoke cooling: Fine water droplets evaporate in the hot gases/flames, lowering temperature and adding water vapour so the mixture becomes non-combustible; this requires droplets smaller than about 0.2 mm.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: For a Follow-up turn, the Question field should be a fully self-contained rewrite of the rag_input that includes necessary context so it can be understood without history. In this instance, Question is identical to rag_input, i.e., not rewritten to be standalone. The Answer is factually correct, but the format requirement for the Question is not met.

Validation failed for title: AT HOP card
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'As of June 2016, what percentage of Auckland adults had an AT HOP card?', 'question': 'As of June 2016, what percentage of Auckland adults had an AT HOP card?', 'answer': '42 percent.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is identical to the 'rag_input' and thus does not provide a standalone rephrasing. The rules require the Question to be a self-contained rephrasing of the rag_input (not identical) so it can be understood without prior turns.

Validation failed for title: Elephant in the room
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How is the idiom used in addiction contexts, and what does the “pink elephant in the room” variant specifically imply?', 'question': 'How is the idiom “elephant in the room” used in addiction contexts, and what does the “pink elephant in the room” variant specifically imply?', 'answer': 'It’s commonly used in addiction recovery to describe the reluctance of friends and family to discuss a person’s addiction, thereby reinforcing denial. The “pink elephant in the room” variant is used especially in reference to alcohol abuse.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to the 'rag_input'. It must be a standalone rephrasing that is self-contained and not a verbatim copy of the RAG_input. It should include necessary context but be distinct in wording from the RAG_input.

Validation failed for title: Elephant in the room
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How about Spanish usage—can you give the Colombian political example and the nickname it yielded?', 'question': 'Is there a notable Spanish-language application of the idiom “elephant in the room”? Describe the 1994 Colombian case involving Ernesto Samper’s presidential campaign, the church leader’s comparison to an elephant entering the living room, and the nickname that the scandal acquired.', 'answer': 'Yes. In Colombia’s 1994 Proceso 8000 investigation into Cali Cartel money allegedly funding Ernesto Samper’s presidential campaign, Cardinal Pedro Rubiano said that not knowing about such funding was like not noticing “an elephant entering one’s living room.” The affair became known as “El Elefante” (“The Elephant”).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' duplicates the 'rag_input' instead of providing a standalone rephrasing; the 'Question' must be a self-contained restatement. Additionally, the required 'Type' field is missing.

Validation failed for title: Russian Blue
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which registries recognize Russian Blues in white and black, and which registries do not recognize these color variations?', 'question': 'Which registries recognize Russian Blues in white and black, and which registries do not recognize these color variations?', 'answer': 'Recognize: ACF and GCCF. Do not recognize: CFA and FIFe.'}
Reason: The provided answer incorrectly includes FIFe as not recognizing the white/black variants. The document states only that ACF and GCCF recognize these variations, and CFA does not; it does not specify FIFe's stance. Therefore the correct answer should be: Recognize: ACF and GCCF. Do not recognize: CFA.

Validation failed for title: Russian Blue
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'After World War II, which breed were Russian Blues crossed with due to low numbers, and do those traits still persist?', 'question': 'After World War II, which breed were Russian Blues crossed with due to low numbers, and do those traits still persist in the breed today?', 'answer': 'They were crossed with Siamese; those traits have largely been bred out, though colorpoint genes still persist in some lines.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the RAG_input. Rule 2 requires a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input that is self-contained and not a verbatim copy.

Validation failed for title: Parens patriae
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Under §4C (15 U.S.C. § 15c), can a state AG recover monetary damages in a parens patriae antitrust action, and is recovery limited to natural-person residents or does it also cover businesses?', 'question': 'Under §4C (15 U.S.C. § 15c), can a state AG recover monetary damages in a parens patriae antitrust action, and is recovery limited to natural-person residents or does it also cover businesses?', 'answer': 'Yes—§§ 15c–15h authorize state attorneys general to seek damages in parens patriae antitrust actions, but recovery is on behalf of their states’ natural-person residents, not business entities.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Violation 1: The Question is identical to the rag_input. It must be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input, not textually identical. Violation 2: The Answer is not factually correct. Controlling precedents (e.g., Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co.) generally limit parens patriae actions under antitrust to injunctive relief rather than damages, and damages, if pursued, are not typically recoverable on behalf of a state's residents as the question implies.

Validation failed for title: Parens patriae
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How do you square Hawaii v. Standard Oil’s injunctive-only rule with later authority allowing state AGs to recover damages as parens patriae?', 'question': 'How should the Supreme Court’s holding in Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. (1972), which limited state parens patriae antitrust actions to injunctive relief, be reconciled with the subsequent Hart–Scott–Rodino amendments (15 U.S.C. §§ 15c–15h) and decisions like Pennsylvania v. Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors that allow state attorneys general to recover damages on behalf of residents?', 'answer': 'Hawaii v. Standard Oil limited parens patriae antitrust suits to injunctive relief under the law as it stood then. Congress later changed the landscape with the Hart–Scott–Rodino amendments (15 U.S.C. §§ 15c–15h), expressly authorizing state attorneys general to seek damages as parens patriae on behalf of their states’ natural-person residents. Courts, including the Fourth Circuit in Pennsylvania v. Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors, have recognized such damage actions. Thus, Hawaii governs pre-1976 or absent statutory authorization; after 1976, damages are permitted as provided by §§ 15c–15h.', 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The answer is not factually correct. Hawaii v. Standard Oil (1972) held that parens patriae antitrust actions are injunctive-only; the Hart–Scott–Rodino amendments do not universally authorize damages recoveries on behalf of residents. The post-1976 landscape is nuanced and varies by context and jurisdiction; the blanket claim that damages are permitted “as provided by §§ 15c–15h” and recoverable for residents is an oversimplification and not consistently supported.

Validation failed for title: Interphase
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Approximately how long is interphase in adult mammalian cells, and what fraction of the total time involved in cell division does it represent?', 'question': 'Approximately how long is interphase in adult mammalian cells, and what fraction of the total time involved in cell division does it represent?', 'answer': 'About 20 hours, roughly 90% of the total time involved in cell division.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to the 'rag_input'. The rules require the 'Question' to be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input (self-contained and paraphrased), not an exact copy. This violates rule 2. The 'Answer' is factually correct, but the overall entry fails due to this mismatch.

Validation failed for title: Fynbos
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which two bird species are noted pollinators in the montane fynbos?', 'question': 'Within montane fynbos and renosterveld, which two bird species are identified as important pollinators?', 'answer': 'The Cape sugarbird and the orange-breasted sunbird.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is not a faithful standalone rephrase of the rag_input: it introduces content not present in the rag_input (it adds 'renosterveld') and uses phrasing ('identified as important pollinators') that goes beyond the original prompt. This violates the requirement that the Question be a self-contained rephrasing of the rag_input. The Answer itself is factually correct, but the overall triplet fails the standalone rephrasing rule.

Validation failed for title: Cobalt-60
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Good. What is Co-60’s half-life and its absorbed dose constant at 1 m? Using that, what 1-hour dose at 1 m does a 2.8 GBq source deliver?', 'question': 'For cobalt-60 (Co-60), what is the half-life and the absorbed dose constant at 1 meter, and based on that constant, what dose is delivered in 1 hour at 1 meter by a 2.8 GBq Co-60 source?', 'answer': 'Half-life ≈ 5.27 years (5.2714 y). Absorbed dose constant = 0.35 mSv/(GBq·h) at 1 m. A 2.8 GBq source delivers about 1 mSv in 1 hour at 1 m (0.98 mSv by calculation).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The previous output is missing the required 'Type' field. It should include 'Type': 'Follow-up' (or another valid category) to conform to the specified schema. The other fields are present and the answer is factually correct.

Validation failed for title: Cold feet
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Given earlier attestations (Reuter 1862; an attribution to Jonson 1605), is Crane the originator or simply a commonly credited early user?', 'question': 'Given that there are earlier attestations of the phrase “cold feet” (e.g., Fritz Reuter in 1862 and an attribution to Ben Jonson in 1605), should Stephen Crane be regarded as the originator or simply a commonly credited early user?', 'answer': 'He is a commonly credited early user, not definitively the originator; the true origin remains debated with earlier attestations cited.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input. The requirement specifies that the Question must be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input (self-contained and not identical). It should be reworded to convey the same meaning without copying the rag_input verbatim.

Validation failed for title: Prime Minister of France
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Who appoints the Prime Minister, and when would cohabitation force appointing an opponent? Give the 1986 example.', 'question': 'Who appoints the Prime Minister, and when would cohabitation force appointing an opponent? Give the 1986 example.', 'answer': 'The President of the Republic appoints the Prime Minister. In a cohabitation—when the National Assembly majority opposes the President—the President must choose a PM reflecting that majority. In 1986, President François Mitterrand appointed Jacques Chirac because the RPR–UDF alliance held the Assembly majority.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is identical to the 'rag_input'. According to the rules, the Question must be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input (self-contained) and not a verbatim copy. It should be reformulated to be self-contained and distinct from the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Cold feet
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'In the marriage context, what does “cold feet” mean, and what did the four-year UCLA study conclude about premarital doubt and later marital outcomes?', 'question': 'In the context of marriage, what does the phrase “cold feet” typically refer to, and what did the four-year UCLA study find about whether premarital uncertainty predicts later marital problems and divorce?', 'answer': 'It refers to pre-wedding fear or uncertainty about the commitment that can even lead a bride or groom to back out. The four-year UCLA study found that premarital doubt was associated with later marital problems and was a viable predictor of divorce.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is identical to the 'rag_input' and thus fails the requirement that the Question be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input. It should be a paraphrase that is self-contained and not identical to the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Cold feet
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How extensive is the research on this phenomenon overall, and is there a notable study?', 'question': 'Regarding “cold feet” in the marriage context, how extensive does the article say the original research is, and which multi-year study does it mention along with its main finding?', 'answer': 'Original research is very limited; it cites a four-year UCLA study showing that premarital doubt is associated with later marital problems and predicts divorce.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question mentions 'the article', i.e., a document, which violates the requirement that the Question be a self-contained standalone paraphrase and must not refer to any document or retrieval process.

Validation failed for title: Be Careful (Cardi B song)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which Lauryn Hill song is interpolated, and which Wu-Tang Clan track does that song sample?', 'question': "In Cardi B’s 'Be Careful,' which Lauryn Hill song is interpolated, and which Wu-Tang Clan track does that Lauryn Hill song sample?", 'answer': 'Ex-Factor; Can It Be All So Simple.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is not identical to 'rag_input'; in the first turn, both should be exactly the same. The rag_input asks 'Which Lauryn Hill song is interpolated, and which Wu-Tang Clan track does that song sample?' while the Question adds 'In Cardi B’s Be Careful,' which makes it a different (non-identical) phrasing.

Validation failed for title: Be Careful (Cardi B song)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What were its peak positions on the Hot 100 and on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs?', 'question': 'For Cardi B\'s single "Be Careful," what were its peak positions on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts?', 'answer': 'No. 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 8 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: RAG_input is ambiguous: it uses 'its' without explicitly naming the subject, relying on prior context to be understood. This fails the requirement that RAG_input be clear, specific, and contextually connected. The accompanying Question does specify Cardi B's Be Careful, but the rag_input itself does not clearly build on the prior turn in a standalone, unambiguous way.

Validation failed for title: Fooled Around and Fell in Love
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Why didn\'t Elvin Bishop sing lead on "Fooled Around and Fell in Love"?', 'question': 'Why didn\'t Elvin Bishop sing lead on the song "Fooled Around and Fell in Love"?', 'answer': 'He felt his gravelly voice wouldn’t do the song justice, so he had his background singer Mickey Thomas sing lead.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to 'rag_input'. It must be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input, not a verbatim copy. It should be self-contained and provide context without copying the rag_input exactly.

Validation failed for title: Hung jury
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Confirm: are 9–3 majority verdicts ever accepted in England and Wales, or is it always 10–2 (10–1 if 11 jurors)?', 'question': 'In jury trials in England and Wales, are 9–3 majority verdicts ever accepted after extended deliberation, or is the minimum majority always 10–2 (or 10–1 if only 11 jurors remain)?', 'answer': '9–3 verdicts are not accepted. The minimum majority is always 10–2 (or 10–1 if only 11 jurors remain), after at least two hours’ deliberation.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: Question is identical to rag_input (not a standalone rephrase); also, Type is missing (must be one of: Follow-up, Clarification, Correction, Comparative). Although the Answer is factually correct, the entry fails rules 2 and 3.

Validation failed for title: Cherry picking
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What is cherry picking (fallacy), and how is it distinct from the "low-hanging fruit" idea?', 'question': 'What is cherry picking (fallacy), and how is it distinct from the "low-hanging fruit" idea?', 'answer': 'Cherry picking is the fallacy of suppressing evidence by selecting only cases or data that support a position while ignoring related evidence that contradicts it (which may be intentional or unintentional). "Low-hanging fruit" instead refers to taking only the easiest-to-harvest items, not selectively reporting favorable evidence.'}
Reason: The context and exact question are satisfied. However, the answer's second part misstates the 'low-hanging fruit' concept. According to the provided document, low-hanging fruit refers to gathering only the easiest-to-harvest items (easy-to-obtain fruit), not to avoiding selective reporting of favorable evidence. This inaccuracy makes the answer incorrect.

Validation failed for title: Cherry picking
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'In medicine, what did the 2002 review of 31 antidepressant efficacy trials conclude about exclusion criteria and the generalizability of their results?', 'question': 'In medicine, what did the 2002 review of 31 antidepressant efficacy trials conclude about exclusion criteria and the generalizability of their results?', 'answer': 'It found that common exclusion criteria meant trial participants represented only a minority of patients seen in routine clinical practice for depression, so the ability to generalize the trials’ efficacy results lacked empirical support.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input; per the rules, it must be a standalone paraphrase of the RAG_input, not an exact duplicate. Additionally, the rag_input should clearly build on the prior turn (be contextually dependent), rather than stand alone. The Answer itself is factually correct, but the overall validation fails due to these structural requirements.

Validation failed for title: Dilip Joshi
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'And where does he live with his family?', 'question': 'Where does Dilip Joshi live with his family?', 'answer': 'Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question field must be exactly identical to the rag_input per the required format. rag_input is 'And where does he live with his family?' while Question is 'Where does Dilip Joshi live with his family?'. The fields do not match exactly; other aspects (RAG_input context, Type, and Answer) are otherwise acceptable.

Validation failed for title: Dilip Joshi
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Since when has Dilip Joshi been playing Jethalal?', 'question': 'Since when has Dilip Joshi been playing Jethalal?', 'answer': 'Since 2008.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is identical to the 'rag_input'; it must be a standalone rephrasing that is self-contained and not identical to the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Cinnamon Girl
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'So who sings the high harmony on "Cinnamon Girl," and how are the vocals arranged?', 'question': 'On Neil Young\'s song "Cinnamon Girl," who sings the high harmony vocal, and how are the vocals arranged?', 'answer': 'Danny Whitten sings the high harmony; the vocals are a duet with Whitten on high harmony and Neil Young on low harmony.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is effectively identical to the 'rag_input' and does not provide a standalone rephrase. The specification requires the 'Question' to be a self-contained rephrasing of the RAG_input that is not identical to it.

Validation failed for title: Hydrate
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Can n be fractional in hydrates—what do hemi- and sesqui- mean?', 'question': 'In hydrate notation, can the number of waters per formula unit (n) be fractional, and what do the prefixes hemi- and sesqui- denote?', 'answer': 'Yes. Hemi- denotes 1/2 and sesqui- denotes 1 1/2.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer only addressed the meanings of hemi- and sesqui-, but did not answer whether the number of waters n per formula unit can be fractional in hydrates. A complete answer should state that n can be fractional in some hydrates (though it is typically an integer) and confirm that hemi- = 1/2 and sesqui- = 3/2 (1.5).

Validation failed for title: Sadness
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'What alternatives are recommended instead?', 'question': "Which alternative coping approaches are recommended instead of ruminating, 'drowning one's sorrows,' or permanent isolation?", 'answer': 'Challenge negative thoughts or schedule a positive event (CBT); be attentive and patient with one’s sadness; use emotional support to help stay with the feeling. Also seek social support or time with a pet, make a list, or express the sadness through activity.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is not identical to the 'rag_input' as required for the first turn. The first-turn question must exactly match the rag_input value ('What alternatives are recommended instead?'), but the provided Question adds extra context about 'coping approaches' and specific examples ('ruminating', 'drowning one's sorrows', 'permanent isolation'), diverging from the exact rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Chop Suey! (song)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Which lines in “Chop Suey!” explicitly reference Jesus’ crucifixion?', 'question': 'In System of a Down’s song “Chop Suey!”, which specific lyric lines explicitly reference Jesus’ death on the cross?', 'answer': '“Father, into your hands I commend my spirit” and “Why have you forsaken me?”', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question field is not an exact restatement of the rag_input. For the first turn, Question must be identical to rag_input text. It should read exactly: 'Which lines in “Chop Suey!” explicitly reference Jesus’ crucifixion?' (no added wording). The current Question deviates by adding introductory phrasing about the song, which breaks the required identical format.

Validation failed for title: Chop Suey! (song)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Was “Chop Suey!” actually banned from airplay after 9/11?', 'question': 'Was “Chop Suey!” actually banned from airplay after 9/11?', 'answer': 'No. It wasn’t completely banned; Clear Channel advised stations not to play it by placing it on a post-9/11 “inappropriate” list.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input. It should be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input (self-contained and not identical). The other fields are acceptable.

Validation failed for title: National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'This is central to the Grange’s political impact: which 1877 Supreme Court case upheld regulation of grain warehouses, and which 1886 case reversed it?', 'question': 'Regarding the Grange’s political impact, which 1877 U.S. Supreme Court case upheld state regulation of grain warehouses as being in the public interest, and which 1886 case later overturned it?', 'answer': 'Munn v. Illinois (1877) upheld it; Wabash v. Illinois (1886) overturned it.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The 'Type' field is not appropriate for this item. The content does not present a correction to a previous answer; it should be Follow-up, Clarification, or Comparative. As a result, this entry fails the Type requirement even though the Question and Answer are correct.

Validation failed for title: Accord and satisfaction
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'If the debtor is sued and pleads accord and satisfaction, who has the burden of proof?', 'question': 'In a lawsuit over an alleged debt where the debtor asserts accord and satisfaction as an affirmative defense, who bears the burden of proof?', 'answer': 'The person sued—the debtor/defendant—bears the burden of proving the affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field should be exactly identical to the 'rag_input' in the first turn. In this instance, the Question adds additional framing and is not a verbatim copy of the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Accord and satisfaction
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'If the accord offers less than originally bargained, must the consideration be different in kind rather than just a lesser sum of money?', 'question': 'If the accord offers less than originally bargained, must the consideration be different in kind rather than just a lesser sum of money?', 'answer': 'Yes. If the accord’s consideration is less than the original, it must be of a different type (e.g., goods or services instead of money), not merely a smaller amount of the same consideration.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field must be a standalone paraphrase of the 'rag_input' and not identical to it. In the provided entry, the 'Question' exactly duplicates the 'rag_input', failing the requirement that it be a self-contained rephrasing that includes necessary context and is not a verbatim copy.

Validation failed for title: Stratovolcano
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How long had Mount Pinatubo been dormant before the 1991 eruption?', 'question': 'How long had Mount Pinatubo been dormant before the 1991 eruption?', 'answer': 'About 600 years.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to the 'rag_input'; it must be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input, not a verbatim copy.

Validation failed for title: Stratovolcano
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How much did it cool the climate, and for how long?', 'question': 'Following the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, by roughly how much did global temperatures drop and for how long did the atmospheric effects persist?', 'answer': 'Cooling in some regions reached about 0.5 °C, and the effects on weather persisted for a few years.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Answer cites regional cooling ('in some regions') rather than the global average cooling that the Question asks about. The Question requests the global temperature drop (approximately 0.5°C) and the duration of atmospheric effects, whereas the Answer references regional cooling and a general 'few years' duration.

Validation failed for title: Sperm motility
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Do we know what regulates the calcium rise that triggers hyperactivation?', 'question': 'Are the factors that regulate the extracellular calcium levels triggering sperm hyperactivation near ovulation in mammals known?', 'answer': 'No. The factors regulating the calcium levels that trigger hyperactivation are unknown.', 'type': 'Clarification'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to 'rag_input' and is not a standalone rephrasing; it should be a self-contained restatement. Additionally, the required 'Type' field is missing (it must be one of Follow-up, Clarification, Correction, or Comparative).

Validation failed for title: Spirit of Ecstasy
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Since 2003, what factory finishes are offered for the Spirit of Ecstasy, and what aftermarket customizations are mentioned?', 'question': 'Since 2003, what factory materials/finishes are available for the Rolls-Royce Spirit of Ecstasy emblem, and what aftermarket customizations are noted?', 'answer': 'Factory options include highly polished stainless steel, stainless with 24‑carat gold plating, and illuminated frosted crystal (the latter two as optional extras). Aftermarket versions include matte black painted and diamond‑studded examples.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input. The rules require the Question to be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input, not a verbatim copy.

Validation failed for title: 416 Fire
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'By July 2, how much had it cost to contain the 416 and Burro fires?', 'question': 'As of July 2, 2018, how much had it cost to contain the 416 and Burro fires in southwest Colorado?', 'answer': 'More than $27 million.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field must be exactly identical to the 'rag_input' for the first turn. It is not; it adds extra context ('As of July 2, 2018' and 'in southwest Colorado'), violating the required first-turn format.

Validation failed for title: 416 Fire
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'By July 2, how close had the Burro Fire come to the 416 Fire, and about how many acres had it burned?', 'question': 'In the 2018 416 & Burro Fire Complex in southwest Colorado, by July 2, 2018, how close had the Burro Fire come to the 416 Fire, and approximately how many acres had it burned?', 'answer': 'It had spread to within 10 miles of the 416 Fire and had burned over 4,000 acres (about 1,619 ha).', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field must be exactly identical to the 'rag_input' for the first turn. It is not; it adds extra context ('In the 2018 416 & Burro Fire Complex in southwest Colorado,') and modifies the phrasing ('by July 2, 2018' vs 'By July 2').

Validation failed for title: Irrigation tank
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Thanks. Next, briefly list the main merits and demerits of tank irrigation.', 'question': 'Briefly list the main merits and demerits of tank irrigation.', 'answer': 'Merits: (1) Many tanks are natural and do not require heavy construction costs; (2) An individual farmer can have his own tank; (3) Tanks built on rocky beds have a long lifespan; (4) Many tanks support fishing, adding food and income. Demerits: (1) Many tanks dry up in the dry season, failing when most needed; (2) Silting of the tank bed is serious and requires regular desilting; (3) High evaporation losses from shallow, wide surfaces; (4) Tanks occupy large areas of cultivable land; (5) In many areas, other irrigation sources have replaced tanks and dry beds are reclaimed for farming; (6) Lifting and conveying water from tanks to fields is strenuous and costly.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to the 'rag_input'. It should be a standalone rephrasing of the prompt, not a verbatim copy. It must be self-contained and understandable without referencing the exact rag_input wording.

Validation failed for title: Solicitor General of Texas
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Where are most of its cases argued?', 'question': 'For the Solicitor General of Texas, where are most of its cases argued?', 'answer': 'In the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Texas.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input; it should be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input that adds context and is not verbatim.

Validation failed for title: Snuff (song)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Which two actors appear in the 'Snuff' short film, and how is Corey Taylor depicted at the end?", 'question': "In Slipknot's 'Snuff' short film, which two actors are featured, and how is Corey Taylor depicted at the end?", 'answer': 'Malcolm McDowell and Ashley Laurence; Corey Taylor appears unmasked and cross-dressed as his ex, exiting the corridor.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to the 'rag_input'; it should be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input (self-contained and understandable without history), not an exact duplicate.

Validation failed for title: As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'In 2 Peter 2:22, what second animal image accompanies the dog, and what does it do?', 'question': 'In 2 Peter 2:22, alongside the dog returning to its vomit, what other animal image is used, and what action does it describe?', 'answer': 'A sow that was washed returning to her wallowing in the mire.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to 'rag_input'; it should be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input, not the same text. It must be self-contained and reworded, not a verbatim duplicate.

Validation failed for title: Pike Place Fish Market
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'It was Ted Turner’s Goodwill Games in 1990. Briefly, how did that event lead to the market’s national exposure?', 'question': 'The Pike Place Fish Market’s national exposure was triggered by Ted Turner’s Goodwill Games in Seattle in 1990. Briefly explain how that event led to their national media coverage.', 'answer': 'News crews covering the Goodwill Games discovered the market, filmed the fish-tossing performances, and this led to national features such as Good Morning America and repeated media coverage.', 'type': 'Correction'}
Reason: The declared Type is Correction, but the content is a follow-up question asking how the event led to national media exposure (i.e., a continuation, not a correction). The Type should be Follow-up (or Clarification) to align with the asked task.

Validation failed for title: All-way stop
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'U.S. all‑way stop: two vehicles arrive at the same time. Who has right‑of‑way?', 'question': 'U.S. all‑way stop: two vehicles arrive at the same time. Who has right‑of‑way?', 'answer': 'The driver on the right; the driver on the left must yield.'}
Reason: Requirement not met: The 'question' must be exactly the same as the 'rag_input'. The rag_input uses a non-breaking hyphen in 'right‑of‑way' while the provided 'question' uses a standard hyphen in 'right-of-way', so the strings are not identical. The context and the answer are consistent with the document, but the exact string match requirement is violated.

Validation failed for title: All-way stop
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'In the U.S., at an all-way stop, two cars arrive at exactly the same time. Who goes first?', 'question': 'In the U.S., at an all-way stop, two cars arrive at exactly the same time. Who goes first?', 'answer': 'The driver on the right goes first; the driver on the left must yield.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: Failure 1: The Question must be a standalone rephrasing of the rag_input and not identical to it. The provided Question is identical to rag_input. Failure 2: The rag_input should clearly build on the prior turn (contextual continuation); the rag_input here reads as a standalone question without explicit linkage to prior conversation.

Validation failed for title: Don't Come Around Here No More
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'For “Don’t Come Around Here No More,” what inspired the title phrase, and who originally said it?', 'question': 'For “Don’t Come Around Here No More,” what inspired the title phrase, and who originally said it?', 'answer': 'It was inspired by David A. Stewart’s romantic encounter with Stevie Nicks; Stevie Nicks originally said the phrase to Joe Walsh after their breakup.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' is identical to the 'rag_input' rather than being a standalone rephrasing. A valid Question should be a self-contained rewording that preserves meaning but is not a verbatim copy of the rag_input.

Validation failed for title: Cedar River (Iowa River tributary)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Upriver during the 2008 flood, which metro area was less affected, and what protected it?', 'question': 'During the 2008 flooding of the Cedar River, which upriver metropolitan area was less affected, and what primarily protected it?', 'answer': 'The Waterloo/Cedar Falls metropolitan area; it was less affected thanks mainly to the large dikes that protect the downtowns of both cities.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Type is 'Follow-up', but the Question simply restates the same query as the previous turn instead of building on or extending the prior answer. A follow-up should introduce new angles or require additional reasoning, not re-ask the same question.

Validation failed for title: David Hale (Sons of Anarchy)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Right before he died, what position was Hale about to officially assume?', 'question': 'In Sons of Anarchy, just before David Hale is killed in the season 3 premiere, what position was he about to officially assume in Charming?', 'answer': 'Chief of Police of Charming.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The first-turn format requires rag_input and Question to be identical. In the last message, rag_input is 'Right before he died, what position was Hale about to officially assume?' while Question adds extra context ('In Sons of Anarchy, just before David Hale is killed in the season 3 premiere, what position was he about to officially assume in Charming?'). They are not identical, violating the first-turn requirement.

Validation failed for title: David Hale (Sons of Anarchy)
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'Whom did Hale try to clear of being a rat, and what happened as a result?', 'question': 'In Sons of Anarchy, whom did Deputy Chief David Hale try to clear of being a rat, and what tragic event occurred anyway as a result?', 'answer': 'Opie Winston; despite Hale’s warning, Opie’s wife Donna was murdered.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The first-turn format requires rag_input and Question to be identical. Here rag_input = 'Right before he died, what position was Hale about to officially assume?' and Question = 'In Sons of Anarchy, just before David Hale is killed in the season 3 premiere, what position was he about to officially assume in Charming?'. They are not identical, so the requirement is violated.

Validation failed for title: Out of left field
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': "Contrast 'out of left field' with 'out in/way out in left field' in meaning.", 'question': "Contrast the idiomatic meanings of 'out of left field' versus 'out in left field' (and 'way out in left field'). What does each typically imply?", 'answer': "'Out of left field' means unexpected or odd/strange. 'Out in left field' implies being removed from the ordinary or out of touch with reality. 'Way out in left field' intensifies this to mean crazy.", 'type': 'Comparative'}
Reason: The Answer only defines 'out of left field' and 'way out in left field' and omits the meaning of 'out in left field' itself. The Question asks to contrast all three idioms and state what each typically implies; the provided Answer is incomplete.

Validation failed for title: Sun path
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'At 70° latitude during the summer solstice, does the Sun set? If not, what are its altitudes at local midnight and local noon?', 'question': 'At 70° latitude during the summer solstice, does the Sun set? If not, what are the Sun’s altitudes at local midnight and at local noon?', 'answer': 'It does not set (polar day). At local midnight it is about 3.44° above the horizon, and at local noon about 43.44° above the horizon.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The 'Question' field is identical to the 'rag_input'; rule 2 requires the Question to be a standalone rephrasing of the RAG_input that is self-contained and not a verbatim copy.

Validation failed for title: You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed
Initial Answer: {'rag_input': 'How did Michael Echeruo compare Okara’s poem to Senghor, David Diop, and J. P. Clark’s “Ivbie,” and what tone qualities did he highlight?', 'question': 'According to Michael Echeruo, how does Gabriel Okara’s “You Laughed and Laughed and Laughed” compare to Senghor’s nostalgic verse, the militancy of David Diop’s lyrics, and J. P. Clark’s “Ivbie,” and which specific tonal qualities of Okara’s poem did he emphasize?', 'answer': 'Echeruo said the piece belongs with the best of Senghor’s nostalgic verse, with the militancy of many of David Diop’s lyrics, and with J. P. Clark’s “Ivbie”; yet Okara’s is more relaxed, more ironic, less tortured—less urgent, less strident, less involved—and appropriately straightforward: proud without arrogance, hurting without showing it, and blunt without rudeness. He also noted it was the first Okara poem he read and, in his view, the most enduring.', 'type': 'Follow-up'}
Reason: The Question is identical to the rag_input. The rules require the Question to be a standalone paraphrase of the RAG_input (not identical) while including necessary context. Here they are the same text, so this criterion is not met. The Type and Answer are acceptable.
