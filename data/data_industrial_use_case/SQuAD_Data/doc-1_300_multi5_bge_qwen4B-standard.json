These systems developed over centuries, primarily rooted in the Vedic tradition and the spiritual, intellectual, and cultural heritage of ancient India.\n\nThe earliest philosophical foundations are derived from the Vedas—ancient sacred texts believed to be revealed knowledge. The six major *astika* (orthodox) philosophical schools—Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa, and Vedanta—all accept the Vedas as authoritative sources of knowledge. These systems evolved from Vedic thought, refining and systematizing concepts related to metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and the nature of reality.\n\nIn addition to these orthodox traditions, there were also *nāstika* (non-orthodox) philosophies—such as Buddhism, Jainism, and Cārvāka—that emerged in ancient India and rejected the authority of the Vedas, yet still contributed significantly to philosophical discourse through alternative views on knowledge, existence, and the self.\n\nThus, Hindu philosophy originated in the Vedic period and flourished through the classical and medieval periods, shaped by both religious revelation and rational inquiry. It is not a single doctrine but a rich, pluralistic tradition that reflects the diverse intellectual and spiritual traditions of Indian civilization.",

The prefix of the URL, the Uniform Resource Identifier or URI, determines how the URL will be interpreted. The most commonly used kind of URI starts with http: and identifies a resource to be retrieved over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Many browsers also support a variety of other prefixes, such as https: for HTTPS, ftp: for the File Transfer Protocol, and file: for local files. Prefixes that the web browser cannot directly handle are often handed off to another application entirely. For example, mailto: URIs are usually passed to the user's default e-mail application, and news: URIs are passed to the user's default newsgroup reader.\nToday, most commercial web browsers are paid by search engine companies to make their engine default, or to include them as another option. For example, Google pays Mozilla, the maker of Firefox, to make Google Search the default search engine in Firefox. Mozilla makes enough money from this deal that it does not need to charge users for Firefox. In addition, Google Search is also (as one would expect) the default search engine in Google Chrome. Users searching for websites or items on the Internet would be led to Google's search results page, increasing ad revenue and which funds development at Google and of Google Chrome."

To produce the Human Development Reports, Mahbub ul Haq formed a group of development economists including Paul Streeten, Frances Stewart, Gustav Ranis, Keith Griffin, Sudhir Anand, and Meghnad Desai. Working alongside Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework. Haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being. Sen initially opposed this idea, but he soon went on to help Haq develop the Index. Sen was worried that it was going to be difficult to capture the full complexity of human capabilities in a single index, but Haq persuaded him that only a single number would shift the immediate attention of politicians from economic to human well-being.\nThe report showed a small increase in world HDI in comparison with last year's report. This rise was fueled by a general improvement in the developing world, especially of the least developed countries group. This marked improvement at the bottom was offset with a decrease in HDI of high income countries."

In many systems, the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the government. In most systems, the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet. In a minority of systems, notably in semi-presidential systems of government, a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state.\nA tipping point in the evolution of the prime ministership came with the death of Anne in 1714 and the accession of George I to the throne. George spoke no English, spent much of his time at his home in Hanover, and had neither knowledge of, nor interest in, the details of English government. In these circumstances it was inevitable that the king's first minister would become the de facto head of the government.\nAppointment of the prime minister of France requires no approval by the parliament either, but the parliament may force the resignation of the government. In these systems, it is possible for the president and the prime minister to be from different political parties if the legislature is controlled by a party different from that of the president. When it arises, such a state of affairs is usually referred to as (political) cohabitation."

      "# Mesozoic\n\nThe Early Jurassic spans from 200 million years to 175 million years ago. The climate was much more humid than the Triassic, and as a result, the world was very tropical. In the oceans, Plesiosaurs, Ichthyosaurs and Ammonites fill waters as the dominant races of the seas. On land, dinosaurs and other reptiles stake their claim as the dominant race of the land, with species such as Dilophosaurus at the top. The first true crocodiles evolved, pushing out the large amphibians to near extinction. All-in-all, reptiles rise to rule the world. Meanwhile, the first true mammals evolve, but remained relatively small sized.\nThe Early Triassic was between 250 million to 247 million years ago and was dominated by deserts as Pangaea had not yet broken up, thus the interior was nothing but arid. The Earth had just witnessed a massive die-off in which 95% of all life went extinct. The most common life on earth were Lystrosaurus, Labyrinthodont, and Euparkeria along with many other creatures that managed to survive the Great Dying. Temnospondyli evolved during this time and would be the dominant predator for much of the Triassic."

    "response": "Ah, a thoughtful question—thank you for dilly-dallying with me in this philosophical chat! 😊\n\nWhile *philosophical physicalism* isn't typically described with \"examples\" in the way one might list species or equations, it's grounded in the idea that *everything that exists is ultimately physical*—not just ordinary matter, but also the more complex and abstract entities that emerge from physical processes.\n\nHere are some key *types* or *forms* of philosophical physicalism, which can be seen as examples of how physicalism extends beyond simple \"matter\":\n\n1. **Spacetime as Fundamental**  \n   Physicalism includes spacetime—not just as a container, but as a real, dynamic entity that plays a foundational role in the structure of reality. This is supported by general relativity, where gravity is the curvature of spacetime itself.\n\n2. **Physical Energies and Fields**  \n   Instead of only thinking of \"matter,\" physicalism embraces energy fields (like electromagnetic fields) as equally fundamental. These fields interact and give rise to particles and forces, showing that energy is not just a property of matter but a primary component of reality.\n\n3. **Forces and Interactions**  \n   The fundamental forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong, and weak) are seen as physical processes—interactions that govern how matter behaves. These are not \"mental\" or \"non-physical\"; they're part of the physical fabric.\n\n4. **Dark Matter and Dark Energy**  \n   These mysterious components of the universe, which make up about 95% of the cosmos, are considered part of physicalism—even if they haven't been directly observed. Their existence is inferred from physical effects (like gravitational lensing or cosmic expansion), and their inclusion in physicalist theories shows how physicalism adapts with scientific discovery.\n\n5. **Mental Phenomena as Emergent Physical Processes**  \n   A major point of debate is whether consciousness is physical. Physicalists argue that thoughts, feelings, and self-awareness arise from complex brain activity—specifically, from neural processes governed by physical laws. This is the view known as *functionalism* or *neural physicalism*.\n\n6. **Quantum Fields and Particles**  \n   In modern physics, particles are not tiny \"balls\" but excitations of quantum fields. This view treats quantum fields as the fundamental reality—something that physicalism embraces as more sophisticated than classical \"matter.\"\n\nSo, to sum up:  \nPhilosophical physicalism doesn’t just say “everything is matter.” It says *everything is physical*, in the broadest sense—spacetime, energy, forces, fields, and even mind—emerging from or being part of physical processes.\n\nAs the text notes, this evolution has led some to prefer the term *physicalism* over *materialism*, because it better captures the depth and scope of modern scientific understanding.\n\nWould you like to explore how this relates to consciousness or free will?

Printing paper is generally between 60 g and 120 g. Anything heavier than 160 g is considered card. The weight of a ream therefore depends on the dimensions of the paper and its thickness.\nIts knowledge and uses spread from China through the Middle East to medieval Europe in the 13th century, where the first water powered paper mills were built. Because of paper's introduction to the West through the city of Baghdad, it was first called bagdatikos. In the 19th century, industrial manufacture greatly lowered its cost, enabling mass exchange of information and contributing to significant cultural shifts.

Although the word paper is etymologically derived from papyrus, the two are produced very differently and the development of the first is distinct from the development of the second. Papyrus is a lamination of natural plant fibres, while paper is manufactured from fibres whose properties have been changed by maceration.\nThere are three main chemical pulping processes: the sulfite process dates back to the 1840s and it was the dominant method extent before the second world war. The kraft process, invented in the 1870s and first used in the 1890s, is now the most commonly practiced strategy, one of its advantages is the chemical reaction with lignin, that produces heat, which can be used to run a generator. Most pulping operations using the kraft process are net contributors to the electricity grid or use the electricity to run an adjacent paper mill. Another advantage is that this process recovers and reuses all inorganic chemical reagents. Soda pulping is another specialty process used to pulp straws, bagasse and hardwoods with high silicate content."

That’s a survival edge in a world where learning and problem-solving can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nSo, in short: better resource use = more energy for essential life functions = better survival chances. 🚀\n\nAnd just like how school cafeterias are improving food quality, nature is constantly optimizing—through evolution, just like James Lind discovered vitamin C decades before science fully understood it. 🍊💪\n\nDilly-dallying with science, one nutrient at a time. 😊",

Currently, less than 10% of American college students report that they eat the recommended five servings of fruit and vegetables daily. Better nutrition has been shown to have an impact on both cognitive and spatial memory performance; a study showed those with higher blood sugar levels performed better on certain memory tests. In another study, those who consumed yogurt performed better on thinking tasks when compared to those that consumed caffeine-free diet soda or confections. Nutritional deficiencies have been shown to have a negative effect on learning behavior in mice as far back as 1951.\nSometimes overlooked during his life, James Lind, a physician in the British navy, performed the first scientific nutrition experiment in 1747. Lind discovered that lime juice saved sailors that had been at sea for years from scurvy, a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. Between 1500 and 1800, an estimated two million sailors had died of scurvy. The discovery was ignored for forty years, after which British sailors became known as \"limeys.\" The essential vitamin C within citrus fruits would not be identified by scientists until 1932."

Pain that lasts a long time is called chronic or persistent, and pain that resolves quickly is called acute. Traditionally, the distinction between acute and chronic pain has relied upon an arbitrary interval of time from onset; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain, though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months.:93 Others apply acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days, chronic to pain of more than six months' duration, and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months. A popular alternative definition of chronic pain, involving no arbitrarily fixed durations, is \"pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing\".

Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition, but typically rather restrained, and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior. The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before, replacing English vernacular architecture (or becoming the new vernacular style) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period."

The ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Benjamin Huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel.

It is also commonly used in bibliographic references and library catalogues.\n\nHistorically, the term \"sentence case\" emerged from the physical layout of printing type cases—where uppercase letters were stored in a case above the case for lowercase letters. This physical arrangement gave rise to the terms \"uppercase\" and \"lowercase,\" and the practice of capitalizing only the first word in a title or heading reflects a natural extension of sentence grammar.\n\nThus, the foundation of sentence-style capitalization is **grammatical consistency**—it applies the rules of standard English sentence structure to headings and titles, making them more readable and linguistically natural.",

If the mixture cools and the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous microstructure of different phases. However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs. These alloys are called intermetallic alloys because, if cooled very quickly, they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase, but they are supersaturated with the secondary constituents. As time passes, the atoms of these supersaturated alloys separate within the crystals, forming intermetallic phases that serve to reinforce the crystals internally."

      "# Dominican_Order\n\nThe center of all mystical experience is, of course, Christ. English Dominicans sought to gain a full knowledge of Christ through an imitation of His life. English mystics of all types tended to focus on the moral values that the events in Christ's life exemplified. This led to a \"progressive understanding of the meanings of Scripture--literal, moral, allegorical, and anagogical\"—that was contained within the mystical journey itself. From these considerations of Scripture comes the simplest way to imitate Christ: an emulation of the moral actions and attitudes that Jesus demonstrated in His earthly ministry becomes the most significant way to feel and have knowledge of God.\nThe expansion of the order produced changes. A smaller emphasis on doctrinal activity favoured the development here and there of the ascetic and contemplative life and there sprang up, especially in Germany and Italy, the mystical movement with which the names of Meister Eckhart, Heinrich Suso, Johannes Tauler, and St. Catherine of Siena are associated. (See German mysticism, which has also been called \"Dominican mysticism.\") This movement was the prelude to the reforms undertaken, at the end of the century, by Raymond of Capua, and continued in the following century. It assumed remarkable proportions in the congregations of Lombardy and the Netherlands, and in the reforms of Savonarola in Florence."

A small amount of water (a weak input signal) flowing into one part of the transistor — like the base of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) — can control a much larger flow of water (a stronger output signal) through another part — like the collector or emitter.\n\nIn electronics:\n- A tiny voltage or current applied to one terminal (like the base) affects a much larger current flowing through another pair of terminals (like the collector and emitter).\n- This amplification happens because the transistor uses the small input signal to \"turn on\" or \"modulate\" a much larger current in the circuit.\n\nSo, the transistor doesn't create energy — it just **controls** a larger current with a smaller one. That’s how it increases or amplifies the signal.\n\nJust like how a small push on a lever can lift a heavy object — the transistor amplifies the input with precision and efficiency.\n\nAnd yes, the junction forward voltage (like in a BJT) plays a role in how easily that small signal can \"turn on\" the larger current — lower voltage means less power needed, which is more efficient.\n\nSo, in short: **The transistor amplifies a signal because it uses a small input to control a large output current — that’s gain.**\n\nWant to dive into how it works in a circuit?

This property is called gain. It can produce a stronger output signal, a voltage or current, which is proportional to a weaker input signal; that is, it can act as an amplifier. Alternatively, the transistor can be used to turn current on or off in a circuit as an electrically controlled switch, where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements.\nThe junction forward voltage is the voltage applied to the emitter–base junction of a BJT in order to make the base conduct a specified current. The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to \"drive\" the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction the change is −2.1 mV/°C. In some circuits special compensating elements (sensistors) must be used to compensate for such changes."

This can cause a date to appear to fall in a different year when converted.\n\nSo, using **two consecutive years** helps clarify:\n- Which calendar system the date originally used (Julian or Gregorian),\n- Whether a date is being interpreted correctly across calendar systems,\n- And avoids misdating historical events due to calendar discrepancies.\n\nIn short: **Dual dating with two consecutive years ensures clarity and accuracy when historical dates are translated between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.** ✅",

These include:\n\n1. **The Pope** – The Bishop of Rome and the supreme leader of the Catholic Church. The Pope is the spiritual head of the Church and holds ultimate authority in matters of doctrine, governance, and discipline.\n\n2. **The Roman Curia** – The central administrative body of the Catholic Church, based in Vatican City. It consists of various departments and congregations (e.g., the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Secretariat of State) that handle governance, policy, and implementation of Church teachings.\n\n3. **The Dioceses** – Geographic regions governed by a local bishop (or archbishop), each overseeing a specific area of the world. Dioceses are the primary local units of the Church, where priests and deacons serve parishes and the faithful.\n\n4. **The Synod of Bishops** – A consultative body composed of bishops from around the world who meet periodically to discuss issues of Church life and governance, offering advice to the Pope.\n\n5. **The Congregations and Tribunals** – Specialized bodies within the Roman Curia that handle specific matters such as canon law, marriage, religious orders, or justice.\n\n6. **The Vatican City State** – The independent sovereign city-state located within Rome, serving as the physical seat of the Catholic Church and home to the Pope and the Roman Curia.\n\n7. **The Catholic Religious Orders** – Groups of men and women dedicated to religious life, such as the Jesuits, Franciscans, Benedictines, and Dominicans, who live in communities and carry out ministries like teaching, pastoral care, and social service.\n\n8. **The Eastern Catholic Churches** – Churches in full communion with the Pope but following distinct liturgical, theological, and canonical traditions (e.g., the Maronite, Chaldean, and Syro-Malabar Churches). Each has its own synod and canonical law, though they remain in communion with Rome.\n\n9. **The Laity, the Priesthood, and the Religious** – The three main categories of the Church’s members. The laity are laypeople who live out their faith in the world; priests are ordained ministers; and religious are individuals who live in community and follow a religious vocation.\n\nThese institutions function together to uphold Catholic doctrine, administer sacraments, teach the faith, and serve the spiritual and social needs of the global Catholic faithful.",

Sampel explains that canon law has significant influence in contemporary society.\nThe law of the Eastern Catholic Churches in full union with Rome was in much the same state as that of the Latin or Western Church before 1917; much more diversity in legislation existed in the various Eastern Catholic Churches. Each had its own special law, in which custom still played an important part. In 1929 Pius XI informed the Eastern Churches of his intention to work out a Code for the whole of the Eastern Church. The publication of these Codes for the Eastern Churches regarding the law of persons was made between 1949 through 1958 but finalized nearly 30 years later."

Revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves, some by deed and others by will, so that from 1782 to 1810, the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the South.\nAfter the Civil War, racial segregation forced African Americans to share more of a common lot in society than they might have given widely varying ancestry, educational and economic levels. The binary division altered the separate status of the traditionally free people of color in Louisiana, for instance, although they maintained a strong Louisiana Créole culture related to French culture and language, and practice of Catholicism.

      "# Post-punk\n\nGenerally, post-punk music is defined as music that emerged from the cultural milieu of punk rock in the late 1970s, although many groups now categorized as post-punk were initially subsumed under the broad umbrella of punk or new wave music, only becoming differentiated as the terms came to signify more narrow styles. Additionally, the accuracy of the term's chronological prefix \"post\" has been disputed, as various groups commonly labeled post-punk in fact predate the punk rock movement. Reynolds defined the post-punk era as occurring loosely between 1978 and 1984."

They rejected the polished, \"sterile\" studio perfectionism of 1960s rock and instead favored rawness, experimentation, and conceptual depth. While they sometimes avoided direct references to earlier genres, they still drew on influences from glam rock, art rock, and the \"dark undercurrents\" of 1960s music.",

      "# Post-punk\n\nThough the music varied widely between regions and artists, the post-punk movement has been characterized by its \"conceptual assault\" on rock conventions and rejection of aesthetics perceived of as traditionalist, hegemonic or rockist in favor of experimentation with production techniques and non-rock musical styles such as dub, electronic music, disco, noise, jazz, krautrock, world music and the avant-garde. While post-punk musicians often avoided or intentionally obscured conventional influences, previous musical styles did serve as touchstones for the movement, including particular brands of glam, art rock and \"[the] dark undercurrent of '60s music\".[nb 1] According to Reynolds, artists once again approached the studio as an instrument, using new recording methods and pursuing novel sonic territories. Author Matthew Bannister wrote that post-punk artists rejected the high cultural references of 1960s rock artists like the Beatles and Bob Dylan as well as paradigms that defined \"rock as progressive, as art, as 'sterile' studio perfectionism ... by adopting an avant-garde aesthetic\"."

While the details of his work are in scientific disrepute, the concept of catastrophic change (extinction event and punctuated equilibrium) has gained acceptance in recent decades.\nIn Eastern Christianity heresy most commonly refers to those beliefs declared heretical by the first seven Ecumenical Councils.[citation needed] Since the Great Schism and the Protestant Reformation, various Christian churches have also used the concept in proceedings against individuals and groups those churches deemed heretical. The Orthodox Church also rejects the early Christian heresies such as Arianism, Gnosticism, Origenism, Montanism, Judaizers, Marcionism, Docetism, Adoptionism, Nestorianism, Monophysitism, Monothelitism and Iconoclasm.\nIn England, the 16th-century European Reformation resulted in a number of executions on charges of heresy.

Intraspecific diversity (different varieties within a species, like different types of wheat) lets farmers switch to more resilient or pest-resistant strains when one crop fails. Interspecific diversity (different species altogether, like switching from wheat to millet) gives us backup options when a crop is destroyed.\n\nSo, the best adaptation isn't just one technology or crop—it's **the system of diversity itself**. Humans have adapted by *preserving and using genetic variation* so that when one thing fails, others can succeed.\n\nThat’s not just farming—it’s a survival strategy rooted in understanding nature.

      "# Biodiversity\n\nIn agriculture and animal husbandry, the Green Revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield. Often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization. Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution. This has resulted in loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole.\nInterspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in what we eat. Intraspecific diversity, the variety of alleles within a single species, also offers us choice in our diets. If a crop fails in a monoculture, we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new. If a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year, relying on intraspecific diversity. We may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether, relying on interspecific diversity. Even an agricultural society which primarily grows monocultures, relies on biodiversity at some point."

      "# Lighting\n\nWith the discovery of fire, the earliest form of artificial lighting used to illuminate an area were campfires or torches. As early as 400,000 BCE, fire was kindled in the caves of Peking Man. Prehistoric people used primitive oil lamps to illuminate surroundings. These lamps were made from naturally occurring materials such as rocks, shells, horns and stones, were filled with grease, and had a fiber wick. Lamps typically used animal or vegetable fats as fuel. Hundreds of these lamps (hollow worked stones) have been found in the Lascaux caves in modern-day France, dating to about 15,000 years ago. Oily animals (birds and fish) were also used as lamps after being threaded with a wick. Fireflies have been used as lighting sources. Candles and glass and pottery lamps were also invented. Chandeliers were an early form of \"light fixture\"."

Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled.

    "response": "Glaciers deform and flow due to the immense stresses induced by their own weight. As a glacier accumulates snow over many years—often centuries—the weight of the ice causes it to slowly deform and flow under gravity. This movement is a result of the ice's plasticity, meaning it can deform over time under pressure rather than breaking or cracking instantly.\n\nThe deformation occurs because the ice is a dense, semi-solid material that, under its own weight, continuously shifts and flows, much like very slow-moving honey. This process creates features such as crevasses, seracs, and moraines. The flow is not uniform; it can be faster in the center of the glacier and slower near the edges, and it’s influenced by factors such as temperature, the amount of snow accumulation, and the underlying bedrock.\n\nIn addition, when meltwater accumulates at the base of a glacier—such as from supraglacial lakes or rising temperatures—it can lubricate the ice-bed interface, allowing the glacier to slide more easily over the ground. This can cause temporary surges in movement, where glaciers accelerate rapidly before returning to a normal pace.",

By mid-century, Modernism had morphed into the International Style, an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center designed by Minoru Yamasaki.\nArchitecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton \"architect\", from ἀρχι- \"chief\" and τέκτων \"builder\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures.

In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the Turbo PC, which sold for $795. PC's Limited advertised its systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. The company grossed more than $73 million in its first year of operation.\nDell was listed at number 51 in the Fortune 500 list, until 2014. After going private in 2013, the newly confidential nature of its financial information prevents the company from being ranked by Fortune. In 2014 it was the third largest PC vendor in the world after Lenovo and HP. Dell is currently the #1 shipper of PC monitors in the world. Dell is the sixth largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to Fortune magazine. It is the second largest non-oil company in Texas – behind AT&T – and the largest company in the Greater Austin area. It was a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: DELL), as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S&P 500, until it was taken private in a leveraged buyout which closed on October 30, 2013."

However, English speakers intuitively treat both sounds as variations (allophones) of the same phonological category, that is of the phoneme /p/.

According to a 2015 poll by Gallup International, 12% of Swiss people self-identified as \"convinced atheists.\"\nDirect democracy and federalism are hallmarks of the Swiss political system. Swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions: the commune, canton and federal levels. The 1848 federal constitution defines a system of direct democracy (sometimes called half-direct or representative direct democracy because it is aided by the more commonplace institutions of a representative democracy). The instruments of this system at the federal level, known as civic rights (Volksrechte, droits civiques), include the right to submit a constitutional initiative and a referendum, both of which may overturn parliamentary decisions."

It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels (red, green, and blue). The infrared channel, in combination with the other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust. Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting.\nInfrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to see. Night vision devices operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light. Infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices, increasing in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source."

These principles are often summarized under the **Five Solae** (the \"Five Points of Solitude\") — though the Five Solae traditionally refer to:\n\n1. *Sola Scriptura* (Scripture alone)  \n2. *Sola Fide* (faith alone)  \n3. *Solus Christus* (Christ alone)  \n4. *Soli Deo Gloria* (glory to God alone)  \n5. *Soli Deo Gloria* (glory to God alone) — sometimes listed as \"only God\"\n\nHowever, in the context of Baptists, *soul competency* (also called *soul liberty*) and *local church autonomy* are **distinctive Baptist additions** to these foundational Protestant beliefs.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly:\n\n👉 These are examples of **Baptist theological and church governance principles** — specifically, **key doctrines that define Baptist identity and practice**.\n\nThey reflect a strong emphasis on:\n- Individual responsibility in faith (soul competency),\n- Justification by faith alone (not by works),\n- The Bible as the final authority in matters of faith and practice,\n- The independence of each local church from centralized denominational control (autonomy).\n\nThese beliefs distinguish Baptists from other Christian traditions, especially within Catholicism and certain forms of Protestantism.",

Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity.\nBeginning in first decade of the 15th century, Jan Hus—a Roman Catholic priest, Czech reformist and professor—influenced by John Wycliffe's writings, founded the Hussite movement. He strongly advocated his reformist Bohemian religious denomination. He was excommunicated and burned at the stake in Constance, Bishopric of Constance in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy. After his execution, a revolt erupted. Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the Pope."

Baptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect. In 1638, Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the mid-18th century, the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South. The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership, as did the preachers' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery, which had been part of the 18th-century teachings.

Some believe symbiosis should only refer to persistent mutualisms, while others believe it should apply to any type of persistent biological interaction (in other words mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic). After 130 years of debate, current biology and ecology textbooks now use the latter \"de Bary\" definition or an even broader definition (where symbiosis means all species interactions), with the restrictive definition no longer used (in other words, symbiosis means mutualism).\nWhile historically, symbiosis has received less attention than other interactions such as predation or competition, it is increasingly recognized as an important selective force behind evolution, with many species having a long history of interdependent co-evolution. In fact, the evolution of all eukaryotes (plants, animals, fungi, and protists) is believed under the endosymbiotic theory to have resulted from a symbiosis between various sorts of bacteria. This theory is supported by certain organelles dividing independently of the cell, and the observation that some organelles seem to have their own nucleic acid."

    "response": "The type of symbiotic relationship where two organisms cannot survive without each other is called **obligate mutualism**.\n\nIn this relationship, both organisms derive benefits, and each is entirely dependent on the other for survival. A classic example given in the text is the relationship between siboglinid tube worms and their symbiotic bacteria. The worms have no digestive tract and rely entirely on the bacteria to provide nutrition by oxidizing hydrogen sulfide or methane, while the bacteria depend on the worm to supply them with the necessary chemicals and environment to survive. Similarly, many lichens consist of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic symbiont that cannot live independently.",
    "retrieved_contexts": [
      "# Symbiosis\n\nOne of the most spectacular examples of obligate mutualism is between the siboglinid tube worms and symbiotic bacteria that live at hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. The worm has no digestive tract and is wholly reliant on its internal symbionts for nutrition. The bacteria oxidize either hydrogen sulfide or methane, which the host supplies to them. These worms were discovered in the late 1980s at the hydrothermal vents near the Galapagos Islands and have since been found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps in all of the world's oceans.\nSome symbiotic relationships are obligate, meaning that both symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival. For example, many lichens consist of fungal and photosynthetic symbionts that cannot live on their own. Others are facultative (optional): they can, but do not have to live with the other organism.\nSymbiosis (from Greek σύν \"together\" and βίωσις \"living\") is close and often long-term interaction between two different biological species. In 1877 Albert Bernhard Frank used the word symbiosis (which previously had been used to depict people living together in community) to describe the mutualistic relationship in lichens. In 1879, the German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as \"the living together of unlike organisms.\""

Currently, promotion from second lieutenant to first lieutenant is virtually guaranteed after two years of satisfactory service. The promotion from first lieutenant to captain is competitive after successfully completing another two years of service, with a selection rate varying between 99% and 100%. Promotion to major through major general is through a formal selection board process, while promotions to lieutenant general and general are contingent upon nomination to specific general officer positions and subject to U.S. Senate approval.\nAirlift is \"operations to transport and deliver forces and materiel through the air in support of strategic, operational, or tactical objectives\" (AFDD 3–17, Air Mobility Operations). The rapid and flexible options afforded by airlift allow military forces and national leaders the ability to respond and operate in a variety of situations and time frames. The global reach capability of airlift provides the ability to apply US power worldwide by delivering forces to crisis locations.

Early contributions came from figures like Paracelsus, who publicly criticized Galen, and Leonardo da Vinci, who compared metabolism to a burning candle. Later, Andreas Vesalius challenged Galen’s ideas, laying the groundwork for modern medical understanding. Additionally, Jan Baptist van Helmont conducted the first quantitative experiments, such as his famous experiment with the willow tree, which contributed to early nutritional science. These developments mark the beginning of a scientific approach to nutrition.",

Also in the 16th century, scientist and artist Leonardo da Vinci compared metabolism to a burning candle. Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject, but he was not afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely disagreed with Galen. Ultimately, 16th century works of Andreas Vesalius, sometimes called the father of modern medicine, overturned Galen's ideas. He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era's mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the mechanics of Newton and Galileo. Jan Baptist van Helmont, who discovered several gases such as carbon dioxide, performed the first quantitative experiment. Robert Boyle advanced chemistry. Sanctorius measured body weight. Physician Herman Boerhaave modeled the digestive process. Physiologist Albrecht von Haller worked out the difference between nerves and muscles."

      "# The_Times\n\nThe Times was founded by publisher John Walter on 1 January 1785 as The Daily Universal Register, with Walter in the role of editor. Walter had lost his job by the end of 1784 after the insurance company where he was working went bankrupt because of the complaints of a Jamaican hurricane. Being unemployed, Walter decided to set a new business up. It was in that time when Henry Johnson invented the logography, a new typography that was faster and more precise (three years later, it was proved that it was not as efficient as had been said). Walter bought the logography's patent and to use it, he decided to open a printing house, where he would daily produce an advertising sheet. The first publication of the newspaper The Daily Universal Register in Great Britain was 1 January 1785. Unhappy because people always omitted the word Universal, Ellias changed the title after 940 editions on 1 January 1788 to The Times. In 1803, Walter handed ownership and editorship to his son of the same name. Walter Sr had spent sixteen months in Newgate Prison for libel printed in The Times, but his pioneering efforts to obtain Continental news, especially from France, helped build the paper's reputation among policy makers and financiers.\nThe Times was the first newspaper to send war correspondents to cover particular conflicts. W. H. Russell, the paper's correspondent with the army in the Crimean War, was immensely influential with his dispatches back to England."

    "response": "The original name of *The Times* was not changed—it was the first newspaper to bear that name. Therefore, it did not have a different name before adopting \"The Times.\" The paper simply began publishing under the name *The Times* and later influenced other newspapers worldwide to use the same name.

      "# The_Times\n\nThe Times is the first newspaper to have borne that name, lending it to numerous other papers around the world, including The Times of India (founded in 1838), The Straits Times (Singapore) (1845), The New York Times (1851), The Irish Times (1859), Le Temps (France) (1861-1942), the Cape Times (South Africa) (1872), the Los Angeles Times (1881), The Seattle Times (1891), The Manila Times (1898), The Daily Times (Malawi) (1900), El Tiempo (Colombia) (1911), The Canberra Times (1926), and The Times (Malta) (1935). In these countries, the newspaper is often referred to as The London Times or The Times of London.\nThe Times is the originator of the widely used Times Roman typeface, originally developed by Stanley Morison of The Times in collaboration with the Monotype Corporation for its legibility in low-tech printing. In November 2006 The Times began printing headlines in a new font, Times Modern. The Times was printed in broadsheet format for 219 years, but switched to compact size in 2004 in an attempt to appeal more to younger readers and commuters using public transport. The Sunday Times remains a broadsheet.\nThe Times occasionally makes endorsements for foreign elections. In November 2012, it endorsed a second term for Barack Obama although it also expressed reservations about his foreign policy."
